saidin and saidar, as the True Source is joined. They died,
all, to make it pure, while the world was torn around them.
Knowing they would die, they charged me to guard it
against the need to come. It was not what I was made for,
but all was breaking apart, and they were alone, and I was
all they had. It was not what I was made for, but I have kept
the faith.” He looked down at Moiraine, nodding to himself.
“I have kept faith, until it was needed. And now it ends.”
“You have kept the faith better than most of us who
gave you the charge,” the Aes Sedai said. “Perhaps it will
not come as badly as you fear.”
The scarred, leafy head shook slowly from side to side.
“I know an ending when it comes, Aes Sedai. I will ﬁnd
another place to make things grow.” Nutbrown eyes swept
sadly over the green forest. “Another place, perhaps. When
you come out, I will see you again, if there is time.” With
that he strode away, trailing butterﬂies, becoming one with
the forest more completely than Lan’s cloak ever could.
“What did he mean?” Mat demanded. “If there’s time?”
“Come,” Moiraine said. And she stepped through the
arch. Lan went at her heels.
Rand was not sure what he expected when he followed.
The hair stirred uneasily on his arms, and rose on the back
of his neck. But it was only a corridor, its polished walls
rounded overhead like the arch, winding gently downward.
There was headroom enough and to spare for Loial; there
would have been room enough for the Green Man. The

Byar’s face went deathly white as the grandfatherly
man spoke; by contrast, the two spots in his hollow cheeks
deepened from red to purple. He cut his eyes toward the
two prisoners for an instant.
He hates us even more, now, Perrin thought, for hearing
this. But why did he hate us in the ﬁrst place?
“What do you think of this?” the Lord Captain said,
holding up Perrin’s axe.
Byar looked a question at his commander and waited for
an answering nod before he broke his rigid stance to take
the weapon. He hefted the axe and gave a surprised grunt,
then whirled it in a tight arc above his head that barely
missed the top of the tent. He handled it as surely as if he
had been born with an axe in his hands. A look of grudging
admiration ﬂickered across his face, but by the time he
lowered the axe he was expressionless once more.
“Excellently balanced, my Lord Captain. Plainly made,
but by a very good weaponsmith, perhaps even a master.”
His eyes burned darkly at the prisoners. “Not a villager’s
weapon, my Lord Captain. Nor a farmer’s.”
“No.” The gray-haired man turned toward Perrin and
Egwene with a weary, slightly chiding smile, a kindly
grandfather who knew his grandchildren had been up to
some mischief. “My name is Geofram Bornhald,” he told
them. “You are Perrin, I understand. But you, young woman,
what is your name?”
Perrin glowered at him, but Egwene shook her head.
“Don’t be silly, Perrin. I’m Egwene.”
“Just Perrin, and just Egwene,” Bornhald murmured. “But

“We do not have days, Child Byar,” the gray-haired man
said mildly. “We ride at dawn. Nothing can change that. We
must be in Caemlyn in time, yes?”
“As you command, my Lord Captain.”
The gray-haired man glanced at Perrin and Egwene,
then away again. “And what have we to show for it, aside
from these two younglings?”
Byar drew a deep breath and hesitated. “I have had the
wolf that was with this lot skinned, my Lord Captain. The
hide should make a ﬁne rug for my Lord Captain’s tent.”
Hopper! Not even realizing what he was doing, Perrin
growled and struggled against his bonds. The ropes dug into
his skin—his wrists became slippery with blood—but they
did not give.
For the ﬁrst time Byar looked at the prisoners. Egwene
started back from him. His face was as expressionless as his
voice, but a cruel light burned in his sunken eyes, as surely
as ﬂames burned in Ba’alzamon’s. Byar hated them as if
they were enemies of long years instead of people never
seen before tonight.
Perrin stared back deﬁantly. His mouth curled into a
tight smile at the thought of his teeth meeting in the man’s
throat.
Abruptly his smile faded, and he shook himself. My
teeth? I’m a man, not a wolf! Light, there has to be an end
to this! But he still met Byar’s glare, hate for hate.
“I do not care about wolf-hide rugs, Child Byar.” The
rebuke in the Lord Captain’s voice was gentle, but Byar’s
back snapped rigid again, his eyes locking to the wall of the
tent. “You were reporting on what we achieved this night,

Stillness ﬁlled the room except for the Aes Sedai’s voice.
“Before Mordeth had been long in the city he had
Balwen’s ear, and soon he was second only to the King.
Mordeth whispered poison in Balwen’s ear, and Aridhol
began to change. Aridhol drew in on itself, hardened. It was
said that some would rather see Trollocs come than the men
of Aridhol. The victory of the Light is all. That was the
battlecry Mordeth gave them, and the men of Aridhol
shouted it while their deeds abandoned the Light.
“The story is too long to tell in full, and too grim, and
only fragments are known, even in Tar Valon. How Thorin’s
son, Caar, came to win Aridhol back to the Second
Covenant, and Balwen sat his throne, a withered shell with
the light of madness in his eyes, laughing while Mordeth
smiled at his side and ordered the deaths of Caar and the
embassy as Friends of the Dark. How Prince Caar came to
be called Caar One-Hand. How he escaped the dungeons of
Aridhol and ﬂed alone to the Borderlands with Mordeth’s
unnatural assassins at his heels. How there he met Rhea,
who did not know who he was, and married her, and set the
skein in the Pattern that led to his death at her hands, and
hers by her own hand before his tomb, and the fall of Aleth-

“Don’t be a fool,” Lan snapped, and Avin’s face folded
into a hurt look.
“I’m only saying what I heard, ain’t I? Just what I heard,
Master Andra. They say, some do, that he’s moving his army
east and south, toward Tear.” His voice became heavy with
meaning. “They say he’s named them the People of the
Dragon.”
“Names mean little,” Moiraine said calmly. If anything
she had heard disturbed her, she gave no outward sign of it
now. “You could call your mule People of the Dragon, if you
wanted.”
“Not likely, mistress.” Avin chuckled. “Not with the
Whitecloaks around, for sure. I don’t expect anybody else
would look kindly on a name like that, neither. I see what
you mean, but . . . oh, no, mistress. Not my mule.”
“No doubt a wise decision,” Moiraine said. “Now we
must be oﬀ.”
“And don’t you worry, mistress,” Avin said, with a deep
bob of his head, “I ain’t seen nobody.” He darted to the gate
and began tugging it closed with quick jerks. “Ain’t seen
nobody, and ain’t seen nothing.” The gate thudded shut,
and he pulled down the locking bar with a rope. “In fact,
mistress, this gate ain’t been open in days.”
“The Light illumine you, Avin,” Moiraine said.
She led them away from the gate, then. Rand looked
back, once, and Avin was still standing in front of the gate.
He seemed to be polishing a coin with an edge of his cloak
and chuckling.

Captain did not tell Byar to leave them alone. Byar met his

skin of his face drew tighter, until it looked like a skull. Perrin
shivered.
“I have heard of this thing of men running with wolves,”
Bornhald said musingly, “though I have not seen it before.
Men supposedly talking with wolves, and with other
creatures of the Dark One. A ﬁlthy business. It makes me
fear the Last Battle is indeed coming soon.”

Even Byar was hidden by the night without his white cloak.
There was nothing by which to orient himself. Any way he
went might be out into the camp.
“Here.”
He stumbled toward Lan’s whisper until hands stopped
him. Egwene was a dim shadow, and Lan’s face was a blur;
the rest of the Warder seemed not to be there at all. He
could feel their eyes on him, and he wondered if he should
explain.
“Put on the cloaks,” Lan said softly. “Quickly. Bundle

his hands were when he was fed and for visits to the latrine
pit. The halter made every step momentous, every rock
underfoot potentially fatal. He walked with muscles tense,
scanning the ground with anxious eyes. Whenever he
glanced at Egwene, she was doing the same. When she met
his eyes, her face was tight and frightened. Neither of them
dared take their eyes oﬀ the ground long enough for more
than a glance.
Usually he collapsed like a wrung-out rag as soon as the
Whitecloaks let him stop, but tonight his mind was racing.
His skin crawled with dread that had been building for days.
If he closed his eyes, he would see only the things Byar
promised for them once they reached Amador.
He was sure Egwene still did not believe what Byar told
them in that ﬂat voice. If she did, she would not be able to
sleep no matter how tired she was. In the beginning he had
not believed Byar either. He still did not want to; people just
did not do things like that to other people. But Byar did not
really threaten; as if he were talking about getting a drink of
water he talked about hot irons and pincers, about knives
slicing away skin and needles piercing. He did not appear to
be trying to frighten them. There was never even a touch of
gloating in his eyes. He just did not care if they were
frightened or not, if they were tortured or not, if they were
alive or not. That was what brought cold sweat to Perrin’s
face once it got through to him. That was what ﬁnally

For a moment Perrin thought he meant the thought from
Dapple. Panic ﬂed across his face, followed by relief. Byar
could not possibly know.
Byar watched his changes of expression, and for the
ﬁrst time the Whitecloak’s eyes went to the rock he had
tossed on the ground.
He was reconsidering, Perrin realized. If he changed his
mind about the rock, would he dare risk leaving them alive

to keep his hands from shaking.
“No men,” Moiraine said. Agelmar opened his mouth
again, and she went on before he could speak. “It is the
nature of the Eye, and the nature of the Green Man. How
many from Fal Dara have ever found the Green Man and the
Eye?”
“Ever?” Agelmar shrugged. “Since the War of the
Hundred Years, you could count them on the ﬁngers of one
hand. No more than one in ﬁve years from all the
Borderlands together.”
“No one ﬁnds the Eye of the World,” Moiraine said,
“unless the Green Man wants them to ﬁnd it. Need is the
key, and intention. I know where to go—I have been there
before.” Rand’s head whipped around in surprise; his was
not the only one among the Emond’s Fielders, but the Aes
Sedai did not seem to notice. “But one among us seeking
glory, seeking to add his name to those four, and we may
never ﬁnd it though I take us straight to the spot I
remember.”
“You have seen the Green Man, Moiraine Sedai?” The
Lord of Fal Dara sounded impressed, but in the next breath
he frowned. “But if you have already met him once. . . .”
“Need is the key,” Moiraine said softly, “and there can
be no greater need than mine. Than ours. And I have
something those other seekers have not.”
Her eyes barely stirred from Agelmar’s face, but Rand
was sure they had drifted toward Loial, just for an instant
before the Aes Sedai pulled them back. Rand met the
Ogier’s eyes, and Loial shrugged.
“Ta’veren,” the Ogier said softly.

mouth tightened with distaste. “And wash him ﬁrst. I may
need to touch him.” Agelmar nodded and spoke softly to
Ingtar, who bowed and disappeared through the door.
“I will not be compelled!” The voice was Fain’s, but he
was no longer crying, and an arrogant snap had replaced
the whine. He stood upright, not crouching at all. Throwing
back his head, he shouted at the ceiling. “Never again! I—
will—not!” He faced Agelmar as if the men ﬂanking him
were his own bodyguard and the Lord of Fal Dara his equal
rather than his captor. His tone became sleek and oily.
“There is a misunderstanding here, Great Lord. I am
sometimes taken by spells, but that will pass soon. Yes, soon
I will be rid of them.” Contemptuously he ﬂicked his ﬁngers
against the rags he wore. “Do not be misled by these, Great
Lord. I have had to disguise myself against those who have
tried to stop me, and my journey has been long and hard.
But at last I have reached lands where men still know the
dangers of Ba’alzamon, where men still ﬁght the Dark One.”
Rand stared, goggling. It was Fain’s voice, but the words
did not sound like the peddler at all.
“So you’ve come here because we ﬁght Trollocs,”
Agelmar said. “And you are so important that someone
wants to stop you. These people say you are a peddler
called Padan Fain, and that you are following them.”
Fain hesitated. He glanced at Moiraine and hurriedly
pulled his eyes away from the Aes Sedai. His gaze ran
across the Emond’s Fielders, then jerked back to Agelmar.

“Need anything else?” Ara asked suddenly. He did not
have much room to talk about people’s accents; he and
Master Fitch both sounded as if they had a mouth full of
mush. “More towels? More hot water?”
“Nothing,” Thom said in his reverberant voice. Eyes
closed, he gave an indolent wave of his hand. “Go and enjoy
the evening. At a later time I will see that you receive more
than adequate recompense for your services.” He settled
lower in the tub, until the water covered everything but his
eyes and nose.
Ara’s eyes went to the stools behind the tubs, where
their clothes and belongings were stacked. He glanced at
the bow, but lingered longest over Rand’s sword and Perrin’s
axe. “Is there trouble downcountry, too?” he said abruptly.
“In the Rivers, or whatever you call it?”
“The Two Rivers,” Mat said, pronouncing each separate
word distinctly. “It’s the Two Rivers. As for trouble, why—”
“What do you mean, too?” Rand asked. “Is there some
kind of trouble here?”
Perrin, enjoying his soak, murmured, “Good! Good!”
Thom raised himself back up a little, and opened his eyes.

One by one the gathering received their orders, each
walled in silence yet still giving tantalizing clues, if only he
could read them. The man of the Atha’an Miere, the Sea
Folk, stiﬀening with reluctance as he nodded. The
Shienaran, his stance be speaking confusion even while he
acquiesced. The second woman of Tar Valon giving a start,
as of shock, and the gray-swathed ﬁgure whose sex he
could not determine shaking its head before falling to its
knees and nodding vigorously. Some underwent the same
convulsion as the Illianer woman, as if pain itself lifted them
to toe tips.
“Bors.”
The man who called himself Bors jerked as a red mask
ﬁlled his eyes. He could still see the room, still see the
ﬂoating shape of Ba’alzamon and the three ﬁgures before
him, but at the same time all he could see was the red-
masked face. Dizzy, he felt as if his skull were splitting open
and his eyes were being pushed out of his head. For a
moment he thought he could see ﬂames through the
eyeholes of the mask.
“Are you faithful . . . Bors?”
The hint of mocking in the name sent a chill down his
backbone. “I am faithful, Great Lord. I cannot hide from
you.” I am faithful! I swear it!
“No, you cannot.”
The certainty in Ba’alzamon’s voice dried his mouth, but
he forced himself to speak. “Command me, Great Lord, and I
obey.”
“Firstly, you are to return to Tarabon and continue your
good works. In fact, I command you to redouble your

Abruptly she turned on the stool to look intently at Elayne,
all her placidity gone as if it had never been. “You have it in
you to be the greatest Queen that Andor has ever seen, that
any land has seen in more than a thousand years. It is for
that we will shape you, if you have the strength for it.”
Rand stared at her. She had to be Elaida, the Aes Sedai.
Suddenly he was glad he had not come to her for help, no
matter what her Ajah. A sternness far beyond Moiraine’s
radiated from her. He had sometimes thought of Moiraine as
steel covered with velvet; with Elaida the velvet was only an
illusion.
“Enough, Elaida,” Morgase said, frowning uneasily. “She
has heard that more than enough. The Wheel weaves as the
Wheel wills.” For a moment she was silent, looking at her
daughter. “Now there is the problem of this young man”—
she gestured to Rand without taking her eyes oﬀ Elayne’s
face—“and how and why he came here, and why you
claimed guest-right for him to your brother.”
“May I speak, mother?” When Morgase nodded her
assent, Elayne told of events simply, from the time she ﬁrst

they ﬁlled their pipes. “Hard to come by, here, but worth the
cost.”
When Loial and the two older men were puﬃng
contentedly, Agelmar glanced at the Ogier. “You seem
troubled, Builder. Not beset by the Longing, I hope. How
long have you been away from the stedding?”
“It is not the Longing; I have not been gone such a time
as that.” Loial shrugged, and the blue-gray streamer rising
from his pipe made a spiral above the table as he gestured.
“I expected—hoped—that the grove would still be here.
Some remnant of Mafal Dadaranell, at least.”
“Kiserai ti Wansho,” Agelmar murmured. “The Trolloc
Wars left nothing but memories, Loial, son of Arent, and
people to build on them. They could not duplicate the
Builders’ work, any more than could I. Those intricate curves
and patterns your people create are beyond human eyes
and hands to make. Perhaps we wished to avoid a poor
imitation that would only have been an ever-present
reminder to us of what we had lost. There is a diﬀerent
beauty in simplicity, in a single line placed just so, a single
ﬂower among the rocks. The harshness of the stone makes
the ﬂower more precious. We try not to dwell too much on
what is gone. The strongest heart will break under that
strain.”

“Perhaps,” Ba’alzamon said simply. “And perhaps not.
Perhaps he can be turned to my use. Sooner or later it will
be so, in this Age or another.”
The man who called himself Bors blinked. In this Age or
another? I thought the Day of Return was near. What matter
to me what happens in another Age if I grow old and die
waiting in this one? But Ba’alzamon was speaking again.
“Already a bend is forming in the Pattern, one of many
points where he who will become the Dragon may be turned
to my service. Must be turned! Better that he serve me alive
than dead, but alive or dead, serve me he must and will!
These three you must know, for each is a thread in the
pattern I mean to weave, and it will be up to you to see that
they are placed as I command. Study them well, that you
will know them.”
Abruptly all sound was gone. The man who called
himself Bors shifted uneasily, and saw others doing the
same. All but the Illianer woman, he realized. With her
hands spread over her bosom as if to hide the rounded ﬂesh
she exposed, eyes wide, half frightened and half ecstatic,
she was nodding eagerly as though to someone face-to-face
with her. Sometimes she appeared to give a reply, but the
man who called himself Bors heard not a word. Suddenly
she arched backwards, trembling and rising on her toes. He
could not see why she did not fall, unless something unseen

“Secondly, you will watch for the three young men, and
have your followers watch. Be warned; they are dangerous.”
The man who called himself Bors glanced at the ﬁgures
ﬂoating in front of Ba’alzamon. How can I do that? I can see
them, but I can’t see anything except his face. His head felt
about to burst. Sweat slicked his hands under his thin
gloves, and his shirt clung to his back. “Dangerous, Great
Lord? Farmboys? Is one of them the—”
“A sword is dangerous to the man at the point, but not
to the man at the hilt. Unless the man holding the sword is a
fool, or careless, or unskilled, in which case it is twice as
dangerous to him as to anyone else. It is enough that I have
told you to know them. It is enough that you obey me.”
“As you command, Great Lord, so shall it be.”
“Thirdly, regarding those who have landed at Toman
Head, and the Domani. Of this you will speak to no one.
When you return to Tarabon. . . .”
The man who called himself Bors realized as he listened
that his mouth was sagging open. The instructions made no
sense. If I knew what some of the others were told, perhaps
I could piece it together.
Abruptly, he felt his head grasped as though by a giant
hand crushing his temples, felt himself being lifted, and the
world blew apart in a thousand starbursts, each ﬂash of light
becoming an image that ﬂed across his mind or spun and

Reﬂected ﬁre made the blade seem aﬂame. Rand
started. He had often daydreamed about owning a sword.
“Give it away? How could you give a sword like that away?”
Tam snorted. “Not much use in herding sheep, now is it?
Can’t plow a ﬁeld or harvest a crop with it.” For a long
minute he stared at the sword as if wondering what he was
doing with such a thing. At last he let out a heavy sigh. “But
if I am not just taken by a black fancy, if our luck runs sour,
maybe in the next few days we’ll be glad I tucked it in that
old chest, instead.” He slid the sword smoothly back into its
sheath and wiped his hand on his shirt with a grimace. “The
stew should be ready. I’ll dish it out while you ﬁx the tea.”
Rand nodded and got the tea canister, but he wanted to
know everything. Why would Tam have bought a sword? He
