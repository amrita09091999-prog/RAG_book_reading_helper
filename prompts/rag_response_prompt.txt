half (saidin) and a female half (saidar), which work at
the same time with and against each other. Only a man
can draw on saidin, only a woman on saidar. Since the
beginning of the Time of Madness, saidin has been
tainted by the Dark One’s touch. See also One Power.

almost see through, a faint blur as wide as his arm was long.
Then it was gone. He thought his skin would creep right oﬀ

“What is it?” he demanded, and was shocked at the
hoarse harshness of his own voice.
“It might be called the essence of saidin.” The Aes

“Don’t be a fool,” Lan snapped, and Avin’s face folded
into a hurt look.
“I’m only saying what I heard, ain’t I? Just what I heard,
Master Andra. They say, some do, that he’s moving his army
east and south, toward Tear.” His voice became heavy with
meaning. “They say he’s named them the People of the
Dragon.”
“Names mean little,” Moiraine said calmly. If anything
she had heard disturbed her, she gave no outward sign of it
now. “You could call your mule People of the Dragon, if you
wanted.”
“Not likely, mistress.” Avin chuckled. “Not with the
Whitecloaks around, for sure. I don’t expect anybody else
would look kindly on a name like that, neither. I see what
you mean, but . . . oh, no, mistress. Not my mule.”
“No doubt a wise decision,” Moiraine said. “Now we
must be oﬀ.”
“And don’t you worry, mistress,” Avin said, with a deep
bob of his head, “I ain’t seen nobody.” He darted to the gate
and began tugging it closed with quick jerks. “Ain’t seen
nobody, and ain’t seen nothing.” The gate thudded shut,
and he pulled down the locking bar with a rope. “In fact,
mistress, this gate ain’t been open in days.”
“The Light illumine you, Avin,” Moiraine said.
She led them away from the gate, then. Rand looked
back, once, and Avin was still standing in front of the gate.
He seemed to be polishing a coin with an edge of his cloak
and chuckling.

the throne instead. Between them, Cowin and Breyan
moved soldiers back from the Blight to seize the Seven
Towers, stripping the Borderforts to bare garrisons.
“But Cowin’s jealousy ran deeper.” Disgust tinged
Agelmar’s voice. “Fairheart the hero, whose exploits in the
Blight were sung throughout the Borderlands, was a
Darkfriend. With the Borderforts weakened, Trollocs poured
into Malkier like a ﬂood. King al’Akir and Lain together might
have rallied the land; they had done so before. But Lain’s
doom in the Blasted Lands had shaken the people, and the
Trolloc invasion broke men’s spirit and their will to resist. Too
many men. Overwhelming numbers pushed the Malkieri
back into the heartland.
“Breyan ﬂed with her infant son Isam, and was run down
by Trollocs as she rode south with him. No one knows their
fate of a certainty, but it can be guessed. I can ﬁnd pity only
for the boy. When Cowin Fairheart’s treachery was revealed
and he was taken by young Jain Charin—already called Jain
Farstrider—when Fairheart was brought to the Seven Towers
in chains, the Great Lords called for his head on a pike. But
because he had been second only to al’Akir and Lain in the
hearts of the people, the King faced him in single combat
and slew him. Al’Akir wept when he killed Cowin. Some say
he wept for a friend who had given himself to the Shadow,
and some say for Malkier.” The Lord of Fal Dara shook his
head sadly.

Ba’alzamon laughed, a rich sound rolling from ﬁre. “Do
you think it is that easy? But then, you always did. Each
time we have stood like this, you have thought you could
defy me.”
“What do mean, each time? I deny you!”
“You always do. In the beginning. This contest between
us has taken place countless times before. Each time your
face is diﬀerent, and your name, but each time it is you.”
“I deny you.” It was a desperate whisper.
“Each time you throw your puny strength against me,

still had strength to kneel. Poor fool, you can never win

“Liar!” he shouted. “Father of Lies. Father of Fools if you
can’t do better than that. Men found you in the last Age, in
the Age of Legends, and bound you back where you
belong.”
Ba’alzamon laughed again, peal after mocking peal,

his hands to stay at his sides. Void or no, they were
trembling when the laughter ﬁnally stopped.

“So you remember that much, at least. Dangerous for
you, fool, not for me. What else do you remember?
Remember, you Light-blinded idiot! I will not let it end with
you swaddled in unawareness! Remember!”
For a moment Lews Therin stared at his raised hand,
fascinated by the patterns of grime. Then he wiped his hand
on his even dirtier coat and turned his attention back to the
other man. “Who are you? What do you want?”
The black-clad man drew himself up arrogantly. “Once I
was called Elan Morin Tedronai, but now—”
“Betrayer of Hope.” It was a whisper from Lews Therin.
Memory stirred, but he turned his head, shying away from it.
“So you do remember some things. Yes, Betrayer of
Hope. So have men named me, just as they named you
Dragon, but unlike you I embrace the name. They gave me
the name to revile me, but I will yet make them kneel and
worship it. What will you do with your name? After this day,
men will call you Kinslayer. What will you do with that?”
Lews Therin frowned down the ruined hall. “Ilyena
should be here to oﬀer a guest welcome,” he murmured
absently, then raised his voice. “Ilyena, where are you?” The
ﬂoor shook; the golden-haired woman’s body shifted as if in
answer to his call. His eyes did not see her.
Elan Morin grimaced. “Look at you,” he said scornfully.
“Once you stood ﬁrst among the Servants. Once you wore
the Ring of Tamyrlin, and sat in the High Seat. Once you

he was as sound in his mind as in his body, but that was

One do such a thing? Kill time itself? And the Eye of the
World? Can he blind the eye of the Great Serpent? What

Rand expected almost anything from Moiraine except
what he saw. Instead of giving Loial an answer, or telling
him she had no time for it now, she stood there staring right
through the Ogier, frowning in thought.

feast, but after close to a week of ﬂatbread and dried meat,
it tasted like one.
After a time, Moiraine asked, “What did you learn in the
common room?” Knives and forks stilled, suspended in
midair, and all eyes turned to the Warder.
“Little that’s good,” Lan replied. “Avin was right, at least
as far as talk has it. There was a battle in Ghealdan, and
Logain was the victor. A dozen diﬀerent stories are ﬂoating
about, but they all agree on that.”

“Perhaps,” Ba’alzamon said simply. “And perhaps not.
Perhaps he can be turned to my use. Sooner or later it will
be so, in this Age or another.”
The man who called himself Bors blinked. In this Age or
another? I thought the Day of Return was near. What matter
to me what happens in another Age if I grow old and die
waiting in this one? But Ba’alzamon was speaking again.
“Already a bend is forming in the Pattern, one of many
points where he who will become the Dragon may be turned
to my service. Must be turned! Better that he serve me alive
than dead, but alive or dead, serve me he must and will!
These three you must know, for each is a thread in the
pattern I mean to weave, and it will be up to you to see that
they are placed as I command. Study them well, that you
will know them.”
Abruptly all sound was gone. The man who called
himself Bors shifted uneasily, and saw others doing the
same. All but the Illianer woman, he realized. With her
hands spread over her bosom as if to hide the rounded ﬂesh
she exposed, eyes wide, half frightened and half ecstatic,
she was nodding eagerly as though to someone face-to-face
with her. Sometimes she appeared to give a reply, but the
man who called himself Bors heard not a word. Suddenly
she arched backwards, trembling and rising on her toes. He
could not see why she did not fall, unless something unseen
held her. Then, just as abruptly, she settled back to her feet
and nodded again, bowing, shivering. Even as she

“Secondly, you will watch for the three young men, and
have your followers watch. Be warned; they are dangerous.”
The man who called himself Bors glanced at the ﬁgures
ﬂoating in front of Ba’alzamon. How can I do that? I can see
them, but I can’t see anything except his face. His head felt
about to burst. Sweat slicked his hands under his thin
gloves, and his shirt clung to his back. “Dangerous, Great
Lord? Farmboys? Is one of them the—”
“A sword is dangerous to the man at the point, but not
to the man at the hilt. Unless the man holding the sword is a
fool, or careless, or unskilled, in which case it is twice as
dangerous to him as to anyone else. It is enough that I have
told you to know them. It is enough that you obey me.”
“As you command, Great Lord, so shall it be.”
“Thirdly, regarding those who have landed at Toman
Head, and the Domani. Of this you will speak to no one.
When you return to Tarabon. . . .”
The man who called himself Bors realized as he listened
that his mouth was sagging open. The instructions made no
sense. If I knew what some of the others were told, perhaps
I could piece it together.
Abruptly, he felt his head grasped as though by a giant
hand crushing his temples, felt himself being lifted, and the
world blew apart in a thousand starbursts, each ﬂash of light
becoming an image that ﬂed across his mind or spun and
dwindled into the distance before he could more than barely
grasp it. An impossible sky of striated clouds, red and yellow

“I have been known by many names, but the one by
which you shall know me is Ba’alzamon.”
The man who called himself Bors clamped his teeth to
keep them from chattering. Ba’alzamon. In the Trolloc
tongue, it meant Heart of the Dark, and even unbelievers
knew it was the Trolloc name for the Great Lord of the Dark.
He Whose Name Must Not Be Uttered. Not the True Name,
Shai’tan, but still forbidden. Among those gathered here,
and others of their kind, to sully either with a human tongue
was blasphemy. His breath whistled through his nostrils, and
all around him he could hear others panting behind their
masks. The servants were gone, and the Trollocs as well,
though he had not seen them go.
“The place where you stand lies in the shadow of Shayol
Ghul.” More than one voice moaned at that; the man who
called himself Bors was not sure his own was not among
them. A touch of what might almost be called mockery
entered Ba’alzamon’s voice as he spread his arms wide.
“Fear not, for the Day of your Master’s rising upon the world
is near at hand. The Day of Return draws nigh. Does it not
tell you so that I am here, to be seen by you favored few
among your brothers and sisters? Soon the Wheel of Time
will be broken. Soon the Great Serpent will die, and with the

will remake the world in his own image for this Age and for

enough to jell your blood and crack your bones? Ahhh!
Winter was cold and harsh everywhere. In the Borderlands
they’d be calling your winter spring. But spring does not
come, you say? Wolves have killed your sheep? Perhaps
wolves have attacked men? Is that the way of it? Well, now.
Spring is late everywhere. There are wolves everywhere, all
hungry for any ﬂesh they can sink a tooth into, be it sheep
or cow or man. But there are things worse than wolves or
winter. There are those who would be glad to have only your
little troubles.” He paused expectantly.
“What could be worse than wolves killing sheep, and
men?” Cenn Buie demanded. Others muttered in support.
“Men killing men.” The peddler’s reply, in portentous
tones, brought shocked murmurs that increased as he went
on. “It is war I mean. There is war in Ghealdan, war and
madness. The snows of the Dhallin Forest are red with the
blood of men. Ravens and the cries of ravens ﬁll the air.
Armies march to Ghealdan. Nations, great houses and great
men, send their soldiers to ﬁght.”
“War?” Master al’Vere’s mouth ﬁt awkwardly around the
unfamiliar word. No one in the Two Rivers had ever had
anything to do with a war. “Why are they having a war?”
Fain grinned, and Rand had the feeling he was mocking
the villagers’ isolation from the world, and their ignorance.

One by one the gathering received their orders, each
walled in silence yet still giving tantalizing clues, if only he
could read them. The man of the Atha’an Miere, the Sea
Folk, stiﬀening with reluctance as he nodded. The
Shienaran, his stance be speaking confusion even while he
acquiesced. The second woman of Tar Valon giving a start,
as of shock, and the gray-swathed ﬁgure whose sex he
could not determine shaking its head before falling to its
knees and nodding vigorously. Some underwent the same
convulsion as the Illianer woman, as if pain itself lifted them
to toe tips.
“Bors.”
The man who called himself Bors jerked as a red mask
ﬁlled his eyes. He could still see the room, still see the
ﬂoating shape of Ba’alzamon and the three ﬁgures before
him, but at the same time all he could see was the red-
masked face. Dizzy, he felt as if his skull were splitting open
and his eyes were being pushed out of his head. For a
moment he thought he could see ﬂames through the
eyeholes of the mask.
“Are you faithful . . . Bors?”
The hint of mocking in the name sent a chill down his
backbone. “I am faithful, Great Lord. I cannot hide from
you.” I am faithful! I swear it!
“No, you cannot.”
The certainty in Ba’alzamon’s voice dried his mouth, but
he forced himself to speak. “Command me, Great Lord, and I
obey.”
“Firstly, you are to return to Tarabon and continue your
good works. In fact, I command you to redouble your
eﬀorts.”

Impossible! What can it mean? And a boy with yellow eyes.
He noticed the Myrddraal looking at the ﬁgures, trembling;
and unless he misjudged entirely, its trembling was no
longer fear, but hatred.
Dead silence had fallen, silence that Ba’alzamon let
deepen before he spoke. “There is now one who walks the
world, one who was and will be, but is not yet, the Dragon.”
A startled murmur ran through his listeners.
“The Dragon Reborn! We are to kill him, Great Lord?”
That from the Shienaran, hand grasping eagerly at his side

The man who called himself Bors ground his teeth, both
at the lack of information and at the implication of
sameness between himself and the servant, but he followed
in silence. Only a fool ranted at a servant, and worse,
remembering the fellow’s eyes, he was not sure it would do
any good. And how did he know what I was going to ask?
The servant smiled.
The man who called himself Bors did not feel at all
comfortable until he was back in the room where he had
waited on ﬁrst arriving, and then not much. Even ﬁnding the
seals on his saddlebags untouched was small comfort.
The servant stood in the hallway, not entering. “You
may change to your own garments if you wish, my Lord.
None will see you depart here, nor arrive at your
destination, but it may be best to arrive already properly
clothed. Someone will come soon to show you the way.”
Untouched by any visible hand, the door swung shut.
The man who called himself Bors shivered in spite of
himself. Hastily he undid the seals and buckles of his
saddlebags and pulled out his usual cloak. In the back of his
mind a small voice wondered if the promised power, even
the immortality, was worth another meeting like this, but he
laughed it down immediately. For that much power, I would
praise the Great Lord of the Dark under the Dome of Truth.
Remembering the commands given him by Ba’alzamon, he

white cloak, and the red shepherd’s crook behind the sun,

Lan shook his head slightly. “Are you really after more
trouble with the Governor? He has limited your numbers in
the town, even had you followed. What will he do when he
discovers you’re harassing honest citizens at his gates?” He
turned to the Watchmen. “Why have you stopped?” They
hesitated, put their hands back on the crank, then hesitated
again when the Whitecloak spoke.
“The Governor does not know what happens under his
nose. There is evil he does not see, or smell. But the
Children of the Light see.” The Watchmen looked at one
another; their hands opened and closed as if regretting the
spears left inside the guard house. “The Children of the
Light smell the evil.” The Whitecloak’s eyes turned to the
people on horseback. “We smell it, and root it out. Wherever
it is found.”
Rand tried to make himself even smaller, but the
movement drew the man’s attention.
“What have we here? Someone who does not wish to be
seen? What do you—? Ah!” The man brushed back the hood
of his white cloak, and Rand was looking at the face he had
known would be there. Bornhald nodded with obvious
satisfaction. “Clearly, Watchman, I have saved you from a
great disaster. These are Darkfriends you were about to help
escape from the Light. You should be reported to your
Governor for discipline, or perhaps given to the Questioners
to discover your true intent this night.” He paused, eyeing
the Watchman’s fear; it seemed to have no eﬀect on him.
