that prison brought about the War of the Shadow, the
tainting of saidin, the Breaking of the World, and the
end of the Age of Legends.
Dark One, naming the: Saying the true name of
the Dark One (Shai’tan) draws his attention, inevitably
bringing ill fortune at best, disaster at worst. For that
reason many euphemisms are used, among them the
Dark One, Father of Lies, Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave,
Shepherd of the Night, Heartsbane, Heartfang,
Grassburner, and Leaf blighter. Someone who seems to
be inviting ill fortune is often said to be “naming the
Dark One.”
Darkfriends: Those who follow the Dark One and
believe they will gain great power and rewards when he
is freed from his prison.
Daughter-heir: Title of the heir to the throne of
Andor. The eldest daughter of the Queen succeeds her
mother on the throne. Without a surviving daughter, the
throne goes to the nearest female blood-relation of the
Queen.
Dha’vol, Dhai’mon (DAH-vohl, DEYE-mon): See
Trollocs.
Djevik K’Shar (DJEH-vihk KEH-SHAHR): In the
Trolloc tongue, “The Dying Ground.” The Trolloc name
for the Aiel Waste.
Domon, Bayle (DOH-mon, BAIL): The captain of the
Spray.
Dragon, the: The name by which Lews Therin
Telamon was known during the War of the Shadow. In
the madness which overtook all male Aes Sedai, Lews
Therin killed every living person who carried any of his
blood, as well as everyone he loved, thus earning the
name Kinslayer. A saying is now used, “taken by the

involved the whole world. In a world where even the
memory of war had been forgotten, every facet of war
was rediscovered, often twisted by the Dark One’s touch
on the World, and the One Power was used as a weapon.
The war was ended by the resealing of the Dark One

bruised himself on the stone. Words sprang to his lips like a
charm against danger—they were a charm, though a thin
reed against what he feared—and he heard a hundred other
voices, breathy with fear, speaking the same against the
ﬂoor.
“The Great Lord of the Dark is my Master, and most
heartily do I serve him to the last shred of my very soul.” In
the back of his mind a voice chattered with fear. The Dark
One and all the Forsaken are bound. . . . Shivering, he forced
it to silence. He had abandoned that voice long since. “Lo,
my Master is death’s Master. Asking nothing do I serve

Return.” The hand of the Creator shelters us all, and the
Light protects us from the Shadow. No, no! A diﬀerent
master. “Swift come the Day of Return. Swift come the Great
Lord of the Dark to guide us and rule the world forever and

The man who called himself Bors ﬁnished the creed

“Great Lord, your might is unquestioned, but can it
stand against the Dark One forever? Do you not often ﬁnd
yourself pressed to hold? Forgive my temerity, Great Lord;
he will crush you in the end, as you are. I know; believe me,
I do. But I can show you how to scour the Shadow from the
land, Great Lord.” His tone became even more unctuous,
though still haughty. “If you but try what I advise, you will
see, Great Lord. You will cleanse the land. You, Great Lord,
can do it, if you direct your might in the right direction.
Avoid letting Tar Valon entangle you in its snares, and you
can save the world. Great Lord, you will be the man

on the long shafts of the bills as if they thought they might

“He thinks a great deal of himself for a peddler,”
Agelmar said to Lan over his shoulder. “I think Ingtar is

grandiose, but if you will only—” He cut oﬀ abruptly,
stepping back, as Moiraine rose and started slowly around

“The Ways were made by men wielding Power fouled by
the Dark One. About a thousand years ago, during what you
humans call the War of the Hundred Years, the Ways began
to change. So slowly in the beginning that none really
noticed, they grew dank and dim. Then darkness fell along
the bridges. Some who went in were never seen again.
Travelers spoke of being watched from the dark. The
numbers who vanished grew, and some who came out had
gone mad, raving about Machin Shin, the Black Wind. Aes
Sedai Healers could aid some, but even with Aes Sedai help
they were never the same. And they never remembered
anything of what had occurred. Yet it was as if the darkness
had sunken into their bones. They never laughed again, and
they feared the sound of the wind.”
For a moment there was silence but for the cat purring
beside Moiraine’s chair, and the snap and crackle of the ﬁre,
popping out sparks. Then Nynaeve burst out angrily, “And
you expect us to follow you into that? You must be mad!”
“Which would you choose instead?” Moiraine asked
quietly. “The Whitecloaks within Caemlyn, or the Trollocs
without? Remember that my presence in itself gives some
protection from the Dark One’s works.”

gallows. “But that’s not for us to worry about, eh,

That thought was only a little less painful. Even so, it

But Lan hesitated, and sweat started on Perrin’s face,
chill beads made colder by the night. They were sliding
down his cheeks by the time the Warder spoke.
“Not in itself, no. Some believe it is, but they are wrong;
it was old and lost long before the Dark One was found. But
what of the chance involved, blacksmith? Sometimes the
Pattern has a randomness to it—to our eyes, at least—but
what chance that you should meet a man who could guide
you in this thing, and you one who could follow the guiding?
The Pattern is forming a Great Web, what some call the Lace
of Ages, and you lads are central to it. I don’t think there is
much chance left in your lives, now. Have you been chosen
out, then? And if so, by the Light, or by the Shadow?”
“The Dark One can’t touch us unless we name him.”
Immediately Perrin thought of the dreams of Ba’alzamon,
the dreams that were more than dreams. He scrubbed the
sweat oﬀ his face. “He can’t.”
“Rock-hard stubborn,” the Warder mused. “Maybe
stubborn enough to save yourself, in the end. Remember
the times we live in, blacksmith. Remember what Moiraine
Sedai told you. In these times many things are dissolving,
and breaking apart. Old barriers weaken, old walls crumble.
The barriers between what is and what was, between what
is and what will be.” His voice turned grim. “The walls of the

“Because of those three,” Lan said angrily. “The ﬁre, the
injured, the going on—all because of those three. The fact
that the price must be paid is proof that it is worth paying.
The Dark One wants those boys of yours, and anything he
wants this badly, he must be kept from. Or would you rather
let the Fade have them?”
“Be at ease, Lan,” Moiraine said. “Be at ease. Wisdom,
you think I can help Master Fitch and the people at the inn?
Well, you are right.” Nynaeve started to say something, but
Moiraine waved it away and went on. “I can go back by
myself and give some help. Not too much, of course. That
would draw attention to those I helped, attention they would
not thank me for, especially with the Children of the Light in
the town. And that would leave only Lan to protect the rest
of you. He is very good, but it will take more than him if a
Myrddraal and a ﬁst of Trollocs ﬁnd you. Of course, we could
all return, though I doubt I can get all of us back into
Baerlon unnoticed. And that would expose all of you to

At least, they hate Trollocs, and Fades.” He was surprised to
see the gaunt-faced man nod as if to himself.
Bornhald raised an eyebrow. “Who told you that?”
“A Warder,” Egwene said. She scrunched away from
Byar’s heated eyes. “He said wolves hate Trollocs, and
Trollocs are afraid of wolves.” Perrin was glad she had not
mentioned Elyas.
“A Warder,” the gray-haired man sighed. “A creature of
the Tar Valon witches. What else would that sort tell you,
when he is a Darkfriend himself, and a servant of
Darkfriends? Do you not know Trollocs have wolves’ muzzles

Perrin blinked, trying to clear his head. His brain still felt
like jellied pain, but there was something wrong here. He
could not get his thoughts straight enough to puzzle it out.
“Not all of them,” Egwene muttered. Perrin gave Byar a
wary look, but the gaunt man only watched her. “Some of
them have horns, like rams or goats, or hawks’ beaks,

Bornhald shook his head sadly. “I give you every
chance, and you dig yourself deeper with every word.” He

but she was leaning forward eagerly.
Mat poked Rand from behind and muttered something, and
he moved on into the tree cavern. Moiraine and Egwene ignored
his entry. The other men crowded in behind him, tossing oﬀ
damp cloaks, settling around the ﬁre, and holding hands out to
the warmth. Lan, the last to enter, pulled waterbags and leather
sacks from a nook in the wall, took out a kettle, and began to
prepare tea. He paid no attention to what the women were
saying, but Rand's friends began to stop toasting their hands and
stare openly. Thom pretended that all of his interest was
engaged in loading his thickly carved pipe, but the way he
leaned toward the women gave him away. Moiraine and Egwene
acted as if they were alone.
“No,” Moiraine said in answer to a question Rand had
missed, “the True Source cannot be used up, any more than the
river can be used up by the wheel of a mill. The Source is the
river; the Aes Sedai, the waterwheel.”
“And you really think I can learn?” Egwene asked. Her face
shone with eagerness. Rand had never seen her look so
beautiful, or so far away from him. “I can become an Aes Sedai?”
Rand jumped up, cracking his head against the low roof of
logs. Thom Merrilin grabbed his arm, yanking him back down.
