nodded to himself; it was just as he had thought. She
rounded on him. “And you’ve been spreading these tales.
Sometimes you have no sense, Rand al’Thor. The winter has
been frightening enough without you going about scaring
the children.”
Rand gave a sour grimace. “I haven’t spread anything,

would have done credit to a bull. “Too long, too long, and so
few to travel and see, it might as well have been none.”
Rand sat there for a minute with his mouth hanging
open, staring up at the apparition in wide-toed, knee-high
boots and a dark blue coat that buttoned from the neck to
the waist, then ﬂared out to his boot tops like a kilt over
baggy trousers. In one hand was a book, seeming tiny by
comparison, with a ﬁnger broad enough for three marking
the place.
“I thought you were—” he began, then caught himself.
“What are—?” That was not any better. Getting to his feet,
he gingerly oﬀered his hand. “My name is Rand al’Thor.”

He thought that perhaps, for Lan, nothing had changed

“I must say,” Loial said, setting the chest down, “that

interesting than I expected.” His ears twitched violently. “If
it becomes any more interesting, I will go back to Stedding
Shangtai immediately, confess everything to Elder Haman,
and never leave my books again.” Suddenly the Ogier
grinned, that wide mouth splitting his face in two. “It is so

voice in the back of his head. So it will all turn out like one of
Thom’s stories? The heroes ﬁnd the treasure and defeat the
villain and live happily ever after? Some of his stories don’t
end that way. Sometimes even heroes die. Are you a hero,
Rand al’Thor? Are you a hero, sheepherder?
Abruptly Mat ﬂushed and pulled his eyes away. Freed
from his thoughts, Rand jumped up to move through the
hurly-burly to the rail. Mat came after him slowly, not even
making an eﬀort to dodge the sailors who ran across his
path.

“If I had told Mother I think you are handsome, she
certainly would have had you locked in a cell.” Elayne
favored him with a dazzling smile. “Fare you well, Rand
al’Thor.”

Morgase’s beauty and majesty.

“She, at least,” Ba’alzamon said, “is mine to do with as I
will.”
Rand shook his head. “I deny you.” He had to force the
words out. “She is dead, and safe from you in the Light.”
His mother’s lips trembled. Tears trickled down her
cheeks; each one burned him like acid. “The Lord of the
Grave is stronger than he once was, my son,” she said. “His

“Do not try to bandy words with her.” Gawyn laughed.
“She will win every time.”
Rand nodded absently. Handsome? Light, the Daughter-
Heir to the throne of Andor! He gave himself a shake to
clear his head.
Gawyn seemed to be waiting for something. Rand
looked at him for a moment.
“My Lord, when I told you I was from the Two Rivers you
were surprised. And everybody else, your mother, Lord
Gareth, Elaida Sedai”—a shiver ran down his back—“none of
them. . . .” He could not ﬁnish it; he was not even sure why
he started. I am Tam al’Thor’s son, even if I was not born in
the Two Rivers.
Gawyn nodded as if it was for this he had been waiting.
Still he hesitated. Rand opened his mouth to take back the
unspoken question, and Gawyn said, “Wrap a shoufa around
your head, Rand, and you would be the image of an
Aielman. Odd, since Mother seems to think you sound like a
Two Rivers man, at least. I wish we could have come to
know one another, Rand al’Thor. Fare you well.”
An Aielman.
Rand stood watching Gawyn’s retreating back until an
impatient cough from Tallanvor reminded him where he was.
He ducked through the sallyport, barely clearing his heels
before Tallanvor slammed it behind him. The bars inside
were jammed into place loudly.
The oval plaza in front of the Palace was empty, now. All
the soldiers gone, all the crowds, trumpets, and drums
vanished in silence. Nothing left but a scattering of litter
blowing across the pavement and a few people hurrying

Rand looked at Gode just in time to see the man’s body
crumble to dust. For an instant the burned face held a look
of sublime joy that turned to horror in the ﬁnal moment, as
if he had seen something waiting he did not expect. Gode’s
empty velvet garments settled on the chair and the ﬂoor
among the ash.
When he turned back, Ba’alzamon’s outstretched hand
had become a ﬁst. “You are mine, youngling, alive or dead.
The Eye of the World will never serve you. I mark you as
mine.” His ﬁst opened, and a ball of ﬂame shot out. It struck
Rand in the face, exploding, searing.
Rand lurched awake in the dark, water dripping through
the cloaks onto his face. His hand trembled as he touched
his cheeks. The skin felt tender, as if sunburned.
Suddenly he realized Mat was twisting and moaning in
his sleep. He shook him, and Mat came awake with a
whimper.
“My eyes! Oh, Light, my eyes! He took my eyes!”
Rand held him close, cradling him against his chest as if
he were a baby. “You’re all right, Mat. You’re all right. He
can’t hurt us. We won’t let him.” He could feel Mat shaking,
sobbing into his coat. “He can’t hurt us,” he whispered, and
wished he believed it. What protects you makes you
vulnerable. I am going mad.
Just before ﬁrst light the downpour dwindled, the last
drizzle fading as dawn came. The clouds remained,
threatening until well into the morning. The wind came up,
then, driving the clouds oﬀ to the south, baring a
warmthless sun and slicing through their dripping wet

The wind died. The screams died. The earth was still.
Dust and smoke swirled back down the pass to surround
him.
“The Light blind you, Ba’alzamon! This has to end!”
IT IS NOT HERE.
It was not Rand’s thought, making his skull vibrate.
I WILL TAKE NO PART. ONLY THE CHOSEN ONE CAN DO
WHAT MUST BE DONE, IF HE WILL.
“Where?” He did not want to say it, but he could not
stop himself. “Where?”
The haze surrounding him parted, leaving a dome of
clear, clean air ten spans high, walled by billowing smoke
and dust. Steps rose before him, each standing alone and
unsupported, stretching up into the murk that obscured the
sun.
NOT HERE.
Through the mist, as from the far end of the earth, came
a cry. “The Light wills it!” The ground rumbled with the
thunder of hooves as the forces of humankind launched
their last charge.
Within the void, his mind knew a moment of panic. The
charging horsemen could not see him in the dust; their
charge would trample right over him. The greater part of
him ignored the shaking ground as a petty thing beneath
concern. Dull anger driving his feet, he mounted the ﬁrst
steps. It has to be ended!
Darkness surrounded him, the utter blackness of total
nothing. The steps were still there, hanging in the black,
under his feet and ahead. When he looked back, those
behind were gone, faded away to nothing, into the
nothingness around him. But the cord was yet there,
stretching behind him, the glowing line dwindling and

“The Council!” Perrin said incredulously. “We’d be lucky

Rand’s father already think the two of us are jumping at

Rand sighed. “If we’re going to do it, we might as well

tomorrow.”

sniﬀed dismissively. “He is too young. You are not from this
place, yes?” he said coldly to Rand. “You come from where?”
“I just arrived in Baerlon.” A tingling thrill ran along
Rand’s arms and legs. He felt ﬂushed, almost warm. “You
wouldn’t know of a good inn, would you?”
“You avoid my questions,” Bornhald snapped. “What evil
is in you that you do not answer me?” His companions
moved up to either side of him, faces hard and
expressionless. Despite the mudstains on their cloaks, there
was nothing funny about them now.

was glad he had learned a little caution. “So they didn’t get
him. I wonder why he left Emond’s Field, without a word like
that? Probably started running then, too, and didn’t stop
until he got here. But why was he running just now?”
Rand shook his head and wished he had not. It felt as
though it might fall oﬀ. “I don’t know, except that he’s afraid
of M . . . Mistress Alys.” All this watching what you said was
not easy. “He doesn’t want her to know he’s here. He made
me promise I wouldn’t tell her.”
“Well, his secret is safe with me,” Mat said. “I wish she
didn’t know where I was, either.”
“Mat?” People still streamed by without paying them
any heed, but Rand lowered his voice anyway, and leaned
closer. “Mat, did you have a nightmare last night? About a
man who killed a rat?”
Mat stared at him without blinking. “You, too?” he said
ﬁnally. “And Perrin, I suppose. I almost asked him this
morning, but. . . . He must have. Blood and ashes! Now
somebody’s making us dream things. Rand, Iwish nobody
knew where I was.”
“There were dead rats all over the inn this morning.” He
did not feel as afraid at saying it as he would have earlier.
He did not feel much of anything. “Their backs were
broken.” His voice rang in his own ears. If he was getting
sick, he might have to go to Moiraine. He was surprised that
even the thought of the One Power being used on him did
not bother him.
Mat took a deep breath, hitching his cloak, and looked
around as if searching for somewhere to go. “What’s

him. Dav thinks he’s down from Taren Ferry—a sheepstealer,
or a chickenthief. A chickenthief!” He lapsed into aﬀronted
silence.
“It’s probably all foolishness anyway,” Rand said ﬁnally.
“Maybe he is just a sheepstealer.” He tried to picture it, but
it was like picturing a wolf taking the cat’s place in front of a
mouse hole.
“Well, I didn’t like the way he looked at me. And neither
did you, not if how you jumped at me is any guide. We
ought to tell someone.”

looked like ﬂesh. It felt like ﬂesh. Light help me, I could feel

Rand was silent for a moment. “You have to keep

“I did, and he laughed. He kept talking about some
eternal war, and saying we’d met like that a thousand times
before, and. . . . Light, Rand, the Dark One knows me.”
“He said the same thing to me. I don’t think he does,”
he added slowly. “I don’t think he knows which of us. . . .”

Mat took a deep breath, hitching his cloak, and looked

“I don’t know. I’m going to ask Thom for advice. About
whether to tell . . . anyone else.”
“No! Not her. Maybe him, but not her.”
The sharpness of it took Rand by surprise. “Then you
believed him?” He did not need to say which “him” he
meant; the grimace on Mat’s face said he understood.

“But you won’t leave it alone.” Rand’s words were half
plea, half command. He was shocked to realize he had
spoken to an Aes Sedai like that, but she seemed not to
notice his tone.
“I will not,” she agreed simply. “I am very tired, Rand,
and I have had no chance to rest since last night. Ordinarily
it would not matter, but for this kind of hurt. . . . This”—she
took a small bundle of white silk from her pouch—“is an
angreal.” She saw his expression. “You know of angreal,
then. Good.”
Unconsciously he leaned back, further away from her
and what she held. A few stories mentioned angreal, those
relics of the Age of Legends that Aes Sedai used to perform
their greatest wonders. He was startled to see her unwrap a
smooth ivory ﬁgurine, age-darkened to deep brown. No
longer than her hand, it was a woman in ﬂowing robes, with
long hair falling about her shoulders.
“We have lost the making of these,” she said. “So much
is lost, perhaps never to be found again. So few remain, the
Amyrlin Seat almost did not allow me to take this one. It is
well for Emond’s Field, and for your father, that she did give
her permission. But you must not hope too much. Now, even
with it, I can do little more than I could have without it
yesterday, and the taint is strong. It has had time to fester.”
“You can help him,” Rand said fervently. “I know you
can.”
Moiraine smiled, a bare curving of her lips. “We shall
see.” Then she turned back to Tam. One hand she laid on his

Rand’s smile broadened; it did not sound as much like
fun to him as it would have a year or two back, but Mat
never seemed to grow up. He took a quick look at his father
—the men had their heads together still, all three talking at
once—then lowered his own voice. “I promised to unload the
cider. I can meet you later, though.”
Mat rolled his eyes skyward. “Toting barrels! Burn me,
I’d rather play stones with my baby sister. Well, I know of
better things than a badger. We have strangers in the Two
Rivers. Last evening—”
For an instant Rand stopped breathing. “A man on
horseback?” he asked intently. “A man in a black cloak, on a
black horse? And his cloak doesn’t move in the wind?”
Mat swallowed his grin, and his voice dropped to an
even hoarser whisper. “You saw him, too? I thought I was
the only one. Don’t laugh, Rand, but he scared me.”
“I’m not laughing. He scared me, too. I could swear he
hated me, that he wanted to kill me.” Rand shivered. Until
that day he had never thought of anyone wanting to kill
him, really wanting to kill him. That sort of thing just did not
happen in the Two Rivers. A ﬁstﬁght, maybe, or a wrestling
match, but not killing.
“I don’t know about hating, Rand, but he was scary
enough anyway. All he did was sit on his horse looking at
me, just outside the village, but I’ve never been so
frightened in my life. Well, I looked away, just for a moment

Rand startled himself by laughing out loud, a laugh of
pure relief. The menacing black-clad rider as a gleeman was
a ridiculous notion, but. . . . He clapped a hand over his
mouth in embarrassment.
“You see, Tam,” Bran said. “There’s been little enough
laughter in this village since winter came. Now even the
gleeman’s cloak brings a laugh. That alone is worth the
expense of bringing him down from Baerlon.”
“Say what you will,” Cenn spoke up suddenly. “I still say
it’s a foolish waste of money. And those ﬁreworks you all

One good thing, at least, Rand thought. If he believes I

Then all we have to worry about is Hake and his bullies. It

Gode kept watching. And smiling.
To Rand the night seemed to last a year. All those eyes
