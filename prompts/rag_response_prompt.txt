Leavetaking
A single lantern, its shutters half closed, hung from a
nail on a stall post, casting a dim light. Deep shadows
swallowed most of the stalls. As Rand came through the
doors from the stableyard, hard on the heels of Mat and the
Warder, Perrin leaped up in a rustle of straw from where he
had been sitting with his back against a stall door. A heavy
cloak swathed him.
Lan barely paused to demand, “Did you look the way I
told you, blacksmith?”
“I looked,” Perrin replied. “There’s nobody here but us.
Why would anybody hide—”
“Care and a long life go together, blacksmith.” The
Warder ran a quick eye around the shadowed stable and the
deeper shadows of the hayloft above, then shook his head.
“No time,” he muttered, half to himself. “Hurry, she says.”
As if to suit his words, he strode quickly to where the
ﬁve horses stood tethered, bridled and saddled at the back
of the pool of light. Two were the black stallion and white
mare that Rand had seen before. The others, if not quite so
tall or so sleek, certainly appeared to be among the best the
Two Rivers had to oﬀer. With hasty care Lan began
examining cinches and girth straps, and the leather ties that
held saddlebags, water-skins, and blanketrolls behind the
saddles.

Tellings of the Wheel
Rand’s heart pounded as he ran, and he stared in
dismay at the barren hills surrounding him. This was not just
a place where spring was late in coming; spring had never
come here, and never would come. Nothing grew in the cold
soil that crunched under his boots, not so much as a bit of
lichen. He scrambled past boulders, twice as tall as he was;
dust coated the stone as if never a drop of rain had touched
it. The sun was a swollen, blood-red ball, more ﬁery than on
the hottest day of summer and bright enough to sear his
eyes, but it stood stark against a leaden cauldron of a sky
where clouds of sharp black and silver roiled and boiled on
every horizon. For all the swirling clouds, though, no breath
of breeze stirred across the land, and despite the sullen sun
the air burned cold like the depths of winter.
Rand looked over his shoulder often as he ran, but he
could not see his pursuers. Only desolate hills and jagged
black mountains, many topped by tall plumes of dark smoke
rising to join the milling clouds. If he could not see his
hunters, though, he could hear them, howling behind him,
guttural voices shouting with the glee of the chase, howling
with the joy of blood to come. Trollocs. Coming closer, and
his strength was almost gone.
With desperate haste he scrambled to the top of a knife-
edged ridge, then dropped to his knees with a groan. Below

Against the Shadow
The land tended upward the way Rand went, but fear
lent his legs strength and they ate ground in long strides,
tearing his way through ﬂowering bushes and tangles of
wildrose, scattering petals, not caring if thorns ripped his
clothes or even his ﬂesh. Moiraine had stopped screaming. It
seemed as if the shrieks had gone on forever, each one
more throat-wrenching than the last, but he knew they had
lasted only moments altogether. Moments before Aginor
would be on his trail. He knew it would be him that Aginor
followed. He had seen the certainty in the Forsaken’s hollow
eyes, in that last second before terror whipped his feet to
run.
The land grew ever steeper, but he scrambled on,
pulling himself forward by handfuls of undergrowth, rocks
and dirt and leaves spilling down the slope from under his
feet, ﬁnally crawling on hands and knees when the slant
became too great. Ahead, above, it leveled out a little.
Panting, he scrabbled his way the last few spans, got to his
feet, and stopped, wanting to howl aloud.
Ten paces in front of him, the hilltop dropped away
sharply. He knew what he would see before he reached it,
but he took the steps anyway, each heavier than the one
before, hoping there might be some track, a goat path,

The Wheel Turns
Dawn revealed devastation in the Green Man’s garden.
The ground was thick with fallen leaves, almost knee-deep
in places. All the ﬂowers were gone except a few clinging
desperately to the edge of the clearing. Little could grow in
the soil under an oak, but a thin circle of ﬂowers and grass
centered on the thick trunk above the Green Man’s grave.
The oak itself retained only half its leaves, and that was far
more than any other tree had, as if some remnant of the
Green Man still fought to hold there. The cool breezes had
died, replaced by a growing sticky heat, the butterﬂies were
gone, the birds silent. It was a silent group who prepared to
leave.
Rand climbed into the bay’s saddle with a sense of loss.
It shouldn’t be this way. Blood and ashes, we won!
“I wish he had found his other place,” Egwene said as
she mounted Bela. A litter, fashioned by Lan, was slung
between the shaggy mare and Aldieb, to carry Moiraine;
Nynaeve would ride beside with the white mare’s reins. The
Wisdom dropped her eyes whenever she saw Lan glance at
her, avoiding his gaze; the Warder looked at her whenever
her eyes were averted, but he would not speak to her. No
one had to ask who Egwene meant.
“It is not right,” Loial said, staring at the oak. The Ogier
was the only one still not mounted. “It is not right that

The Peddler
Clusters of pots clattered and banged as the peddler’s
wagon rumbled over the heavy timbers of the Wagon
Bridge. Still surrounded by a cloud of villagers and farmers
come for Festival, the peddler reined his horses to a stop in
front of the inn. From every direction people streamed to
swell the numbers around the great wagon, its wheels taller
than any of the people with their eyes fastened to the
peddler above them on the wagon seat.
The man on the wagon was Padan Fain, a pale, skinny
fellow with gangly arms and a massive beak of a nose. Fain,
always smiling and laughing as if he knew a joke that no one
else knew, had driven his wagon and team into Emond’s
Field every spring for as long as Rand could remember.
The door of the inn ﬂew open even as the team halted
in a jangle of harness, and the Village Council appeared, led
by Master al’Vere and Tam. They marched out deliberately,
even Cenn Buie, amid all the excited shouting of the others
for pins or lace or books or a dozen other things. Reluctantly
the crowd parted to let them to the fore, everyone closing in
quickly behind and never stopping their calling to the
peddler. Most of all, the villagers called for news.
In the eyes of the villagers, needles and tea and the like
were no more than half the freight in a peddler’s wagon.
Every bit as important was word of outside, news of the

The Blight
The wind whipped Lan’s cloak, sometimes making him
hard to see even in the sunlight, and Ingtar and the hundred
lances Lord Agelmar had sent to escort them to the Border,
in case they met a Trolloc raid, made a brave display in
double column with their armor and their red pennants and
their steel-clad horses led by Ingtar’s Gray Owl banner. They
were easily as grand as a hundred of the Queen’s Guards,
but it was the towers just in sight ahead of them that Rand
studied. He had had all morning to watch the Shienaran
lances.
Each tower stood tall and solid atop a hill, half a mile
from its neighbor. East and west others rose, and more
beyond those. A broad, walled ramp spiraled around each
stone shaft, winding all the way around by the time it
reached the heavy gates halfway to the crenellated top. A
sortie from the garrison would be protected by the wall until
it reached the ground, but enemies striving to reach the
gate would climb under a hail of arrows and stones and hot
oil from the big kettles poised on the outward ﬂaring
ramparts above. A large steel mirror, carefully turned down,
away from the sun, now, glittered atop each tower below
the high iron cup where signal ﬁres could be lit when the
sun did not shine. The signal would be ﬂashed, to towers
further from the Border, and by those to still others, and so

Winternight
The sun stood halfway down from its noonday high by
the time the cart reached the farmhouse. It was not a big
house, not nearly so large as some of the sprawling
farmhouses to the east, dwellings that had grown over the
years to hold entire families. In the Two Rivers that often
included three or four generations under one roof, including
aunts, uncles, cousins, and nephews. Tam and Rand were
considered out of the ordinary as much for being two men
living alone as for farming in the Westwood.
Here most of the rooms were on one ﬂoor, a neat
rectangle with no wings or additions. Two bedrooms and an
attic storeroom ﬁtted up under the steeply sloped thatch. If
the whitewash was all but gone from the stout wooden walls
after the winter storms, the house was still in a tidy state of
repair, the thatch tightly mended and the doors and
shutters well-hung and snug-ﬁtting.
House, barn, and stone sheep pen formed the points of
a triangle around the farmyard, where a few chickens had
ventured out to scratch at the cold ground. An open
shearing shed and a stone dipping trough stood next to the
sheep pen. Hard by the ﬁelds between the farmyard and the
trees loomed the tall cone of a tight-walled curing shed. Few
farmers in the Two Rivers could make do without both wool
and tabac to sell when the merchants came.

The Dark One Stirs
Dawn woke Rand with a start, the sullen sun pricking
his eyelids as it peeked reluctantly over the treetops of the
Blight. Even so early, heat covered the spoiled lands in a
heavy blanket. He lay on his back with his head pillowed on
his blanketroll, staring at the sky. It was still blue, the sky.
Even here, that, at least, was untouched.
He was surprised to realize that he had slept. For a
minute the dim memory of a conversation overheard
seemed like part of some dream. Then he saw Nynaeve’s
red-rimmed eyes; she had not slept, obviously. Lan’s face
was harder than ever, as if he had resumed a mask and did
not intend to let it slip again.
Egwene went over and crouched beside the Wisdom,
her face concerned. He could not make out what they said.
Egwene spoke, and Nynaeve shook her head. Egwene said
something else, and the Wisdom waved her away
dismissively. Instead of going, Egwene bent her head closer,
and for a few minutes the two women talked even more
softly, with Nynaeve still shaking her head. The Wisdom
ended it with a laugh, hugging Egwene and, by her
expression, making soothing talk. When Egwene stood,
though, she glared at the Warder. Lan did not seem to
notice; he did not look in Nynaeve’s direction at all.

Strangers
When Rand and Mat carried the ﬁrst barrels through
the common room, Master al’Vere was already ﬁlling a pair
of mugs with his best brown ale, his own make, from one of
the casks racked against one wall. Scratch, the inn’s yellow
cat, crouched atop it with his eyes closed and his tail
wrapped around his feet. Tam stood in front of the big
ﬁreplace of river rock, thumbing a long-stemmed pipe full of
tabac from a polished canister the innkeeper always kept on
the plain stone mantel. The ﬁreplace stretched half the
length of the big, square room, with a lintel as high as a
man’s shoulder, and the crackling blaze on the hearth
vanquished the chill outside.
At that time of the busy day before Festival, Rand
expected to ﬁnd the common room empty except for Bran
and his father and the cat, but four more members of the
Village Council, including Cenn, sat in high-backed chairs in
front of the ﬁre, mugs in hand and blue-gray pipesmoke
wreathing their heads. For once none of the stones boards
were in use, and all of Bran’s books stood idle on the shelf
opposite the ﬁreplace. The men did not even talk, peering
silently into their ale or tapping pipestems against their
teeth in impatience, as they waited for Tam and Bran to join
them.
Worry was not uncommon for the Village Council these
days, not in Emond’s Field, and likely not in Watch Hill, or

Master Gill took them to a corner table in the common
room and had one of the serving maids bring them food.
Rand shook his head when he saw the plates, with a few
thin slices of gravy-covered beef, a spoonful of mustard
greens, and two potatoes on each. It was a rueful, resigned
headshake, though, not angry. Not enough of anything, the
innkeeper had said. Picking up his knife and fork, Rand
wondered what would happen when there was nothing left.
It made his half-covered plate seem like a feast. It made him
shiver.
Master Gill had chosen a table well away from anyone
else, and he sat with his back to the corner, where he could
watch the room. Nobody could get close enough to overhear
what they said without him seeing. When the maid left, he
said softly, “Now, why don’t you tell me about this trouble of
yours? If I’m going to help, I’d best know what I’m getting
into.”
Rand looked at Mat, but Mat was frowning at his plate as
if he were mad at the potato he was cutting. Rand took a
deep breath. “I don’t really understand it myself,” he began.
He kept the story simple, and he kept Trollocs and Fades
out of it. When somebody oﬀered help, it would not do to
tell them it was all about fables. But he did not think it was
fair to understate the danger, either, not fair to pull
someone in when they had no idea what they were getting

The Last Village
It was after dark when they reached Carysford, longer
than Rand had thought it would take from what Master
Kinch said when he let them down. He wondered if his whole
sense of time was getting skewed. Only three nights since
Howal Gode and Four Kings, two since Paitr had surprised
them in Market Sheran. Just a bare day since the nameless
Darkfriend woman tried to kill them in the stable of The
Queen’s Man, but even that seemed a year ago, or a
lifetime.
Whatever was happening to time, Carysford appeared
normal enough, on the surface, at least. Neat, vine-covered
brick houses and narrow lanes, except for the Caemlyn Road
itself, quiet and outwardly peaceful. But what’s underneath?
he wondered. Market Sheran had been peaceful to look at,
and so had the village where the woman. . . . He had never
learned the name of that one, and he did not want to think
about it.
Light spilled from the windows of the houses into streets
all but empty of people. That suited Rand. Slinking from
corner to corner, he avoided the few people abroad. Mat
stuck to his shoulder, freezing when the crunch of gravel
announced the approach of a villager, dodging from shadow
to shadow when the dim shape had gone past.
The River Cary was a bare thirty paces wide there, and
the black water moved sluggishly, but the ford had long

their people to escape. From the city of Manetheren, Eldrene
organized the ﬂight of her people into the deepest forests
and the fastness of the mountains.
“But some did not ﬂee. First in a trickle, then a river,
then a ﬂood, men went, not to safety, but to join the army
ﬁghting for their land. Shepherds with bows, and farmers
with pitchforks, and woodsmen with axes. Women went, too,
shouldering what weapons they could ﬁnd and marching
side by side with their men. No one made that journey who
did not know they would never return. But it was their land.
It had been their fathers’, and it would be their children’s,
and they went to pay the price of it. Not a step of ground
was given up until it was soaked in blood, but at the last the
army of Manetheren was driven back, back to here, to this
place you now call Emond’s Field. And here the Trolloc
hordes surrounded them.”
Her voice held the sound of cold tears. “Trolloc dead and
the corpses of human renegades piled up in mounds, but

any but the women to stand. Smoke from a small ﬁre on a bed of
river stones drifted up and through; the draft was enough to
keep the space free of smoke, but the interweaving was too thick
to let out even a glimmer of the ﬂames. Moiraine and Egwene,
their cloaks thrown aside, sat cross-legged, facing one another
beside the ﬁre.
“The One Power,” Moiraine was saying, “comes from the True
Source, the driving force of Creation, the force the Creator made
to turn the Wheel of Time.” She put her hands together in front
of her and pushed them against each other. “Saidin, the male
half of the True Source, and saidar, the female half, work against

“All the stories are real,” he muttered.
“So it seems, lad,” the blacksmith said. “So it seems.”
Rand only half heard. He was concentrating on following
Egwene’s slender shape. He had pulled himself together just
enough to wish she would hurry, though in truth she was
keeping her pace to what the two men could manage with
their burden. She led them halfway down the Green, to the
Calder house. Char blackened the edges of its thatch, and
smut stained the whitewashed walls. Of the houses on
either side only the foundation stones were left, and two
piles of ash and burned timbers. One had been the house of
Berin Thane, one of the miller’s brothers. The other had
been Abell Cauthon’s. Mat’s father. Even the chimneys had
toppled.
“Wait here,” Egwene said, and gave them a look as if
expecting an answer. When they only stood there, she
muttered something under her breath, then dashed inside.
“Mat,” Rand said. “Is he . . . ?”
“He’s alive,” the blacksmith said. He set down his end of
the litter and straightened slowly. “I saw him a little while
ago. It’s a wonder any of us are alive. The way they came

Shaking his head, Rand gathered his things, and gave
his hands and face and teeth a hasty wash with the little
water Lan allowed for such things. He wondered if women
had a way of reading men’s minds. It was an unsettling
thought. All women are Aes Sedai. Telling himself he was
letting the Blight get to him, he rinsed out his mouth and
hurried to get the bay saddled.
It was more than a little disconcerting, having the
campsite disappear before he reached the horses, but by
the time his saddle girth was tight everything on the hill
winked back into view. Everyone was hurrying.
The seven towers stood plain in the morning light,
distant broken stumps, like huge, rough hills that merely
hinted at grandeur gone. The hundred lakes were a smooth,
unruﬄed blue. Nothing broke the surface this morning.
When he looked at the lakes and the ruined towers, he could
almost ignore the sickly things growing around the hill. Lan
did not seem to be avoiding looking at the towers, any more
than he seemed to be avoiding Nynaeve, but somehow he
never did as he concentrated on getting them ready to go.
After the wicker panniers were fastened on the pack
horse, after every scrap and smudge and track were gone
and everyone else was mounted, the Aes Sedai stood in the
middle of the hilltop with her eyes closed, not even seeming
to breathe. Nothing happened that Rand could see, except
that Nynaeve and Egwene shivered despite the heat and
rubbed their arms briskly. Egwene’s hands suddenly froze on

folded on the bedside table, and a blanket was drawn up
under his chin. When Rand touched his father’s forehead,
Tam opened his eyes.
“There you are, boy. Marin said you were here, but I
couldn’t even sit up to see. She said you were too tired for
her to wake just so I could look at you. Even Bran can’t get
around her when she has her mind set.”
Tam’s voice was weak, but his gaze was clear and
steady. The Aes Sedai was right, Rand thought. With rest he
would be as good as ever.
“Can I get you something to eat? Mistress al’Vere left a
tray.”
“She fed me already . . . if you can call it that. Wouldn’t
let me have anything but broth. How can a man avoid bad
dreams with nothing but broth in his. . . .” Tam fumbled a
hand from under the cover and touched the sword at Rand’s
waist. “Then it wasn’t a dream. When Marin told me I was
sick, I thought I had been. . . . But you’re all right. That is all
that matters. What of the farm?”
Rand took a deep breath. “The Trollocs killed the sheep.
I think they took the cow, too, and the house needs a good
cleaning.” He managed a weak smile. “We were luckier than
some. They burned half the village.”
He told Tam everything that had happened, or at least
most of it. Tam listened closely, and asked sharp questions,
so he found himself having to tell about returning to the
farmhouse from the woods, and that brought in the Trolloc
he had killed. He had to tell how Nynaeve had said Tam was

“Tell us about Lenn,” Egwene called. “How he ﬂew to the
moon in the belly of an eagle made of ﬁre. Tell about his
daughter Salya walking among the stars.”
Rand looked at her out of the corner of his eye, but she
seemed intent on the gleeman. She had never liked stories
about adventures and long journeys. Her favorites were
always the funny ones, or stories about women outwitting
people who were supposed to be smarter than everyone
else. He was sure she had asked for tales about Lenn and
Salya to put a burr under his shirt. Surely she could see the
world outside was no place for Two Rivers folk. Listening to
tales of adventures, even dreaming about them, was one
thing; having them take place around you would be
something else again.

was juggling three colored balls with each hand. “Stories

even older. But I have all stories, mind you now, of Ages that

He shifted uncomfortably.
“You say you’re going to Caemlyn,” Elyas said, “but that
still doesn’t explain what you’re doing out here, days from
anywhere.” He tossed back his fur-patch cloak and lay down
on his side, propped on one elbow and waiting expectantly.
Perrin glanced at Egwene. Early on they had concocted
a story for when they found people, to explain where they
were going without bringing them any trouble. Without
letting anyone know where they were really from, or where
they were really going, eventually. Who knew what careless
word might reach a Fade’s ear? They had worked on it every
day, patching it together, honing out ﬂaws. And they had
decided Egwene was the one to tell it. She was better with
words than he was, and she claimed she could always tell
when he was lying by his face.
Egwene began at once, smoothly. They were from the
north, from Saldaea, from farms outside a tiny village.
Neither of them had been more than twenty miles from
home in their whole lives before this. But they had heard
gleemen’s stories, and merchants’ tales, and they wanted to
see some of the world. Caemlyn, and Illian. The Sea of
Storms, and maybe even the fabled islands of the Sea Folk.
Perrin listened with satisfaction. Not even Thom Merrilin
could have made a better tale from the little they knew of
the world outside the Two Rivers, or one better suited to
their needs.
“From Saldaea, eh?” Elyas said when she was done.
Perrin nodded. “That’s right. We thought about seeing
