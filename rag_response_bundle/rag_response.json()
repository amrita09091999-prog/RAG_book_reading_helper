I mark you as\nmine.\u201d His \ufb01st opened, and a ball of \ufb02ame shot out. It struck\nRand in the face, exploding, searing.\nRand lurched awake in the dark, water dripping through\nthe cloaks onto his face. His hand trembled as he touched\nhis cheeks. The skin felt tender, as if sunburned.\nSuddenly he realized Mat was twisting and moaning in\nhis sleep. He shook him, and Mat came awake with a\nwhimper.\n\u201cMy eyes! Oh, Light, my eyes!

Don\u2019t laugh, Rand, but he scared me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not laughing. He scared me, too. I could swear he\nhated me, that he wanted to kill me.\u201d Rand shivered. Until\nthat day he had never thought of anyone wanting to kill\nhim, really wanting to kill him. That sort of thing just did not\nhappen in the Two Rivers.
