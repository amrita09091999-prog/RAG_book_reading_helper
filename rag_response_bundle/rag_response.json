Lan, the last to enter, pulled waterbags and leather\nsacks from a nook in the wall, took out a kettle, and began to\nprepare tea. He paid no attention to what the women were\nsaying, but Rand's friends began to stop toasting their hands and\nstare openly. Thom pretended that all of his interest was\nengaged in loading his thickly carved pipe, but the way he\nleaned toward the women gave him away. Moiraine and Egwene\nacted as if they were alone.\n\u201cNo,\u201d Moiraine said in answer to a question Rand had\nmissed, \u201cthe True Source cannot be used up, any more than the\nriver can be used up by the wheel of a mill. The Source is the\nriver; the Aes Sedai, the waterwheel.\u201d\n\u201cAnd you really think I can learn?\u201d Egwene asked. Her face\nshone with eagerness. Rand had never seen her look so\nbeautiful, or so far away from him. \u201cI can become an Aes Sedai?\u201d\nRand jumped up, cracking his head against the low roof of\nlogs. Thom Merrilin grabbed his arm, yanking him back down.", "response": "In this story, the Dark One (Shai\u2019tan) is the source of evil, the antithesis of the Creator. He was imprisoned at Shayol Ghul at the moment of Creation. His release triggers catastrophic events \u2014 the War of the Shadow, tainting of saidin, Breaking of the World, and end of the Age of Legends. The Creator, though not directly described as a \u201cgod,\u201d is portrayed as the force who imprisoned the Dark One and created the world. The Dark One is feared and avoided \u2014 naming him invites disaster. He is also bound with the Forsaken, thirteen powerful beings sealed in Shayol Ghul with him. The Dark One\u2019s influence spreads through the Shadow, corrupting the world and driving conflict. The Creator\u2019s power is seen as protective, shielding the Light from the Shadow. The story centers on the struggle between these two forces \u2014 the Light, represented by the Creator\u2019s creation and the Aes Sedai, versus the Shadow, embodied by the Dark One and his followers. The Wheel turns, and the fate of the world hinges on this eternal battle."}
