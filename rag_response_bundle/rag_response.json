With the Borderforts weakened, Trollocs poured\ninto Malkier like a \ufb02ood. King al\u2019Akir and Lain together might\nhave rallied the land; they had done so before. But Lain\u2019s\ndoom in the Blasted Lands had shaken the people, and the\nTrolloc invasion broke men\u2019s spirit and their will to resist. Too\nmany men.

Sooner or later it will\nbe so, in this Age or another.\u201d\nThe man who called himself Bors blinked. In this Age or\nanother? I thought the Day of Return was near. What matter\nto me what happens in another Age if I grow old and die\nwaiting in this one? But Ba\u2019alzamon was speaking again.\n\u201cAlready a bend is forming in the Pattern, one of many\npoints where he who will become the Dragon may be turned\nto my service. Must be turned! Better that he serve me alive\nthan dead, but alive or dead, serve me he must and will!\nThese three you must know, for each is a thread in the\npattern I mean to weave, and it will be up to you to see that\nthey are placed as I command. Study them well, that you\nwill know them.\u201d\nAbruptly all sound was gone. The man who called\nhimself Bors shifted uneasily, and saw others doing the\nsame. All but the Illianer woman, he realized. With her\nhands spread over her bosom as if to hide the rounded \ufb02esh\nshe exposed, eyes wide, half frightened and half ecstatic,\nshe was nodding eagerly as though to someone face-to-face\nwith her. Sometimes she appeared to give a reply, but the\nman who called himself Bors heard not a word. Suddenly\nshe arched backwards, trembling and rising on her toes. He\ncould not see why she did not fall, unless something unseen\nheld her. Then, just as abruptly, she settled back to her feet\nand nodded again, bowing, shivering. Even as she\n\n---\n\nDocument 12\nChapter Number: 53\nChapter Name: The Wheel Turns\nPage Number: 960\n\nContent:\n\u201cSecondly, you will watch for the three young men, and\nhave your followers watch. Be warned; they are dangerous.\u201d\nThe man who called himself Bors glanced at the \ufb01gures\n\ufb02oating in front of Ba\u2019alzamon. How can I do that? I can see\nthem, but I can\u2019t see anything except his face. His head felt\nabout to burst. Sweat slicked his hands under his thin\ngloves, and his shirt clung to his back. \u201cDangerous, Great\nLord? Farmboys?

It is enough that you obey me.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command, Great Lord, so shall it be.\u201d\n\u201cThirdly, regarding those who have landed at Toman\nHead, and the Domani. Of this you will speak to no one.\nWhen you return to Tarabon.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\nThe man who called himself Bors realized as he listened\nthat his mouth was sagging open. The instructions made no\nsense. If I knew what some of the others were told, perhaps\nI could piece it together.\nAbruptly, he felt his head grasped as though by a giant\nhand crushing his temples, felt himself being lifted, and the\nworld blew apart in a thousand starbursts, each \ufb02ash of light\nbecoming an image that \ufb02ed across his mind or spun and\ndwindled into the distance before he could more than barely\ngrasp it.

Ba\u2019alzamon. In the Trolloc\ntongue, it meant Heart of the Dark, and even unbelievers\nknew it was the Trolloc name for the Great Lord of the Dark.\nHe Whose Name Must Not Be Uttered. Not the True Name,\nShai\u2019tan, but still forbidden. Among those gathered here,\nand others of their kind, to sully either with a human tongue\nwas blasphemy. His breath whistled through his nostrils, and\nall around him he could hear others panting behind their\nmasks. The servants were gone, and the Trollocs as well,\nthough he had not seen them go.\n\u201cThe place where you stand lies in the shadow of Shayol\nGhul.\u201d More than one voice moaned at that; the man who\ncalled himself Bors was not sure his own was not among\nthem. A touch of what might almost be called mockery\nentered Ba\u2019alzamon\u2019s voice as he spread his arms wide.\n\u201cFear not, for the Day of your Master\u2019s rising upon the world\nis near at hand. The Day of Return draws nigh. Does it not\ntell you so that I am here, to be seen by you favored few\namong your brothers and sisters? Soon the Wheel of Time\nwill be broken.

There is war in Ghealdan, war and\nmadness. The snows of the Dhallin Forest are red with the\nblood of men. Ravens and the cries of ravens \ufb01ll the air.\nArmies march to Ghealdan.

What will he do when he\ndiscovers you\u2019re harassing honest citizens at his gates?\u201d He\nturned to the Watchmen. \u201cWhy have you stopped?\u201d They\nhesitated, put their hands back on the crank, then hesitated\nagain when the Whitecloak spoke.\n\u201cThe Governor does not know what happens under his\nnose. There is evil he does not see, or smell. But the\nChildren of the Light see.\u201d The Watchmen looked at one\nanother; their hands opened and closed as if regretting the\nspears left inside the guard house. \u201cThe Children of the\nLight smell the evil.\u201d The Whitecloak\u2019s eyes turned to the\npeople on horseback. \u201cWe smell it, and root it out. Wherever\nit is found.\u201d\nRand tried to make himself even smaller, but the\nmovement drew the man\u2019s attention.\n\u201cWhat have we here? Someone who does not wish to be\nseen? What do you\u2014? Ah!\u201d The man brushed back the hood\nof his white cloak, and Rand was looking at the face he had\nknown would be there. Bornhald nodded with obvious\nsatisfaction. \u201cClearly, Watchman, I have saved you from a\ngreat disaster. These are Darkfriends you were about to help\nescape from the Light. You should be reported to your\nGovernor for discipline, or perhaps given to the Questioners\nto discover your true intent this night.\u201d He paused, eyeing\nthe Watchman\u2019s fear; it seemed to have no e\ufb00ect on him.", "response": "Saidin is the male half of the True Source, the driving force of the universe that turns the Wheel of Time. It works alongside saidar (the female half) but is tainted by the Dark One\u2019s touch since the Time of Madness. Only men can draw on saidin, while women can only access saidar. The True Source is divided into these two halves, which operate simultaneously \u2014 both together and in opposition. Saidin is also referred to as the \u201cessence of saidin\u201d in some contexts, and it\u2019s part of the One Power. Its use is tied to the larger cosmic struggle, and its corruption plays a key role in the unfolding of events in the world."}
