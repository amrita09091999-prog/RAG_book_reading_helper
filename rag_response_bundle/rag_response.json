Deep shadows\nswallowed most of the stalls. As Rand came through the\ndoors from the stableyard, hard on the heels of Mat and the\nWarder, Perrin leaped up in a rustle of straw from where he\nhad been sitting with his back against a stall door. A heavy\ncloak swathed him.\nLan barely paused to demand, \u201cDid you look the way I\ntold you, blacksmith?\u201d\n\u201cI looked,\u201d Perrin replied. \u201cThere\u2019s nobody here but us.\nWhy would anybody hide\u2014\u201d\n\u201cCare and a long life go together, blacksmith.\u201d The\nWarder ran a quick eye around the shadowed stable and the\ndeeper shadows of the hayloft above, then shook his head.\n\u201cNo time,\u201d he muttered, half to himself. \u201cHurry, she says.\u201d\nAs if to suit his words, he strode quickly to where the\n\ufb01ve horses stood tethered, bridled and saddled at the back\nof the pool of light. Two were the black stallion and white\nmare that Rand had seen before. The others, if not quite so\ntall or so sleek, certainly appeared to be among the best the\nTwo Rivers had to o\ufb00er. With hasty care Lan began\nexamining cinches and girth straps, and the leather ties that\nheld saddlebags, water-skins, and blanketrolls behind the\nsaddles.\n\n---\n\nDocument 2\nChapter Number: 9\nChapter Name: Tellings of the Wheel\nPage Number: 157\n\nContent:\nCHAPTER\n9\nTellings of the Wheel\nRand\u2019s heart pounded as he ran, and he stared in\ndismay at the barren hills surrounding him. This was not just\na place where spring was late in coming; spring had never\ncome here, and never would come. Nothing grew in the cold\nsoil that crunched under his boots, not so much as a bit of\nlichen. He scrambled past boulders, twice as tall as he was;\ndust coated the stone as if never a drop of rain had touched\nit. The sun was a swollen, blood-red ball, more \ufb01ery than on\nthe hottest day of summer and bright enough to sear his\neyes, but it stood stark against a leaden cauldron of a sky\nwhere clouds of sharp black and silver roiled and boiled on\nevery horizon. For all the swirling clouds, though, no breath\nof breeze stirred across the land, and despite the sullen sun\nthe air burned cold like the depths of winter.\nRand looked over his shoulder often as he ran, but he\ncould not see his pursuers. Only desolate hills and jagged\nblack mountains, many topped by tall plumes of dark smoke\nrising to join the milling clouds. If he could not see his\nhunters, though, he could hear them, howling behind him,\nguttural voices shouting with the glee of the chase, howling\nwith the joy of blood to come. Trollocs. Coming closer, and\nhis strength was almost gone.\nWith desperate haste he scrambled to the top of a knife-\nedged ridge, then dropped to his knees with a groan.

Moiraine had stopped screaming. It\nseemed as if the shrieks had gone on forever, each one\nmore throat-wrenching than the last, but he knew they had\nlasted only moments altogether. Moments before Aginor\nwould be on his trail. He knew it would be him that Aginor\nfollowed. He had seen the certainty in the Forsaken\u2019s hollow\neyes, in that last second before terror whipped his feet to\nrun.\nThe land grew ever steeper, but he scrambled on,\npulling himself forward by handfuls of undergrowth, rocks\nand dirt and leaves spilling down the slope from under his\nfeet, \ufb01nally crawling on hands and knees when the slant\nbecame too great. Ahead, above, it leveled out a little.\nPanting, he scrabbled his way the last few spans, got to his\nfeet, and stopped, wanting to howl aloud.\nTen paces in front of him, the hilltop dropped away\nsharply. He knew what he would see before he reached it,\nbut he took the steps anyway, each heavier than the one\nbefore, hoping there might be some track, a goat path,\n\n---\n\nDocument 4\nChapter Number: 53\nChapter Name: The Wheel Turns\nPage Number: 915\n\nContent:\nCHAPTER\n53\nThe Wheel Turns\nDawn revealed devastation in the Green Man\u2019s garden.\nThe ground was thick with fallen leaves, almost knee-deep\nin places. All the \ufb02owers were gone except a few clinging\ndesperately to the edge of the clearing. Little could grow in\nthe soil under an oak, but a thin circle of \ufb02owers and grass\ncentered on the thick trunk above the Green Man\u2019s grave.\nThe oak itself retained only half its leaves, and that was far\nmore than any other tree had, as if some remnant of the\nGreen Man still fought to hold there. The cool breezes had\ndied, replaced by a growing sticky heat, the butter\ufb02ies were\ngone, the birds silent. It was a silent group who prepared to\nleave.\nRand climbed into the bay\u2019s saddle with a sense of loss.\nIt shouldn\u2019t be this way. Blood and ashes, we won!\n\u201cI wish he had found his other place,\u201d Egwene said as\nshe mounted Bela. A litter, fashioned by Lan, was slung\nbetween the shaggy mare and Aldieb, to carry Moiraine;\nNynaeve would ride beside with the white mare\u2019s reins. The\nWisdom dropped her eyes whenever she saw Lan glance at\nher, avoiding his gaze; the Warder looked at her whenever\nher eyes were averted, but he would not speak to her. No\none had to ask who Egwene meant.\n\u201cIt is not right,\u201d Loial said, staring at the oak. The Ogier\nwas the only one still not mounted. \u201cIt is not right that\n\n---\n\nDocument 5\nChapter Number: 3\nChapter Name: The Peddler\nPage Number: 55\n\nContent:\nCHAPTER\n3\nThe Peddler\nClusters of pots clattered and banged as the peddler\u2019s\nwagon rumbled over the heavy timbers of the Wagon\nBridge. Still surrounded by a cloud of villagers and farmers\ncome for Festival, the peddler reined his horses to a stop in\nfront of the inn. From every direction people streamed to\nswell the numbers around the great wagon, its wheels taller\nthan any of the people with their eyes fastened to the\npeddler above them on the wagon seat.\nThe man on the wagon was Padan Fain, a pale, skinny\nfellow with gangly arms and a massive beak of a nose. Fain,\nalways smiling and laughing as if he knew a joke that no one\nelse knew, had driven his wagon and team into Emond\u2019s\nField every spring for as long as Rand could remember.\nThe door of the inn \ufb02ew open even as the team halted\nin a jangle of harness, and the Village Council appeared, led\nby Master al\u2019Vere and Tam. They marched out deliberately,\neven Cenn Buie, amid all the excited shouting of the others\nfor pins or lace or books or a dozen other things. Reluctantly\nthe crowd parted to let them to the fore, everyone closing in\nquickly behind and never stopping their calling to the\npeddler. Most of all, the villagers called for news.\nIn the eyes of the villagers, needles and tea and the like\nwere no more than half the freight in a peddler\u2019s wagon.\nEvery bit as important was word of outside, news of the\n\n---\n\nDocument 6\nChapter Number: 48\nChapter Name: The Blight\nPage Number: 852\n\nContent:\nCHAPTER\n48\nThe Blight\nThe wind whipped Lan\u2019s cloak, sometimes making him\nhard to see even in the sunlight, and Ingtar and the hundred\nlances Lord Agelmar had sent to escort them to the Border,\nin case they met a Trolloc raid, made a brave display in\ndouble column with their armor and their red pennants and\ntheir steel-clad horses led by Ingtar\u2019s Gray Owl banner. They\nwere easily as grand as a hundred of the Queen\u2019s Guards,\nbut it was the towers just in sight ahead of them that Rand\nstudied. He had had all morning to watch the Shienaran\nlances.\nEach tower stood tall and solid atop a hill, half a mile\nfrom its neighbor. East and west others rose, and more\nbeyond those. A broad, walled ramp spiraled around each\nstone shaft, winding all the way around by the time it\nreached the heavy gates halfway to the crenellated top. A\nsortie from the garrison would be protected by the wall until\nit reached the ground, but enemies striving to reach the\ngate would climb under a hail of arrows and stones and hot\noil from the big kettles poised on the outward \ufb02aring\nramparts above. A large steel mirror, carefully turned down,\naway from the sun, now, glittered atop each tower below\nthe high iron cup where signal \ufb01res could be lit when the\nsun did not shine. The signal would be \ufb02ashed, to towers\nfurther from the Border, and by those to still others, and so\n\n---\n\nDocument 7\nChapter Number: 5\nChapter Name: Winternight\nPage Number: 90\n\nContent:\nCHAPTER\n5\nWinternight\nThe sun stood halfway down from its noonday high by\nthe time the cart reached the farmhouse. It was not a big\nhouse, not nearly so large as some of the sprawling\nfarmhouses to the east, dwellings that had grown over the\nyears to hold entire families. In the Two Rivers that often\nincluded three or four generations under one roof, including\naunts, uncles, cousins, and nephews. Tam and Rand were\nconsidered out of the ordinary as much for being two men\nliving alone as for farming in the Westwood.\nHere most of the rooms were on one \ufb02oor, a neat\nrectangle with no wings or additions. Two bedrooms and an\nattic storeroom \ufb01tted up under the steeply sloped thatch. If\nthe whitewash was all but gone from the stout wooden walls\nafter the winter storms, the house was still in a tidy state of\nrepair, the thatch tightly mended and the doors and\nshutters well-hung and snug-\ufb01tting.\nHouse, barn, and stone sheep pen formed the points of\na triangle around the farmyard, where a few chickens had\nventured out to scratch at the cold ground. An open\nshearing shed and a stone dipping trough stood next to the\nsheep pen. Hard by the \ufb01elds between the farmyard and the\ntrees loomed the tall cone of a tight-walled curing shed. Few\nfarmers in the Two Rivers could make do without both wool\nand tabac to sell when the merchants came.\n\n---\n\nDocument 8\nChapter Number: 49\nChapter Name: The Dark One Stirs\nPage Number: 866\n\nContent:\nCHAPTER\n49\nThe Dark One Stirs\nDawn woke Rand with a start, the sullen sun pricking\nhis eyelids as it peeked reluctantly over the treetops of the\nBlight. Even so early, heat covered the spoiled lands in a\nheavy blanket. He lay on his back with his head pillowed on\nhis blanketroll, staring at the sky. It was still blue, the sky.\nEven here, that, at least, was untouched.\nHe was surprised to realize that he had slept. For a\nminute the dim memory of a conversation overheard\nseemed like part of some dream. Then he saw Nynaeve\u2019s\nred-rimmed eyes; she had not slept, obviously. Lan\u2019s face\nwas harder than ever, as if he had resumed a mask and did\nnot intend to let it slip again.\nEgwene went over and crouched beside the Wisdom,\nher face concerned. He could not make out what they said.\nEgwene spoke, and Nynaeve shook her head. Egwene said\nsomething else, and the Wisdom waved her away\ndismissively. Instead of going, Egwene bent her head closer,\nand for a few minutes the two women talked even more\nsoftly, with Nynaeve still shaking her head. The Wisdom\nended it with a laugh, hugging Egwene and, by her\nexpression, making soothing talk. When Egwene stood,\nthough, she glared at the Warder. Lan did not seem to\nnotice; he did not look in Nynaeve\u2019s direction at all.\n\n---\n\nDocument 9\nChapter Number: 2\nChapter Name: Strangers\nPage Number: 39\n\nContent:\nCHAPTER\n2\nStrangers\nWhen Rand and Mat carried the \ufb01rst barrels through\nthe common room, Master al\u2019Vere was already \ufb01lling a pair\nof mugs with his best brown ale, his own make, from one of\nthe casks racked against one wall. Scratch, the inn\u2019s yellow\ncat, crouched atop it with his eyes closed and his tail\nwrapped around his feet. Tam stood in front of the big\n\ufb01replace of river rock, thumbing a long-stemmed pipe full of\ntabac from a polished canister the innkeeper always kept on\nthe plain stone mantel. The \ufb01replace stretched half the\nlength of the big, square room, with a lintel as high as a\nman\u2019s shoulder, and the crackling blaze on the hearth\nvanquished the chill outside.\nAt that time of the busy day before Festival, Rand\nexpected to \ufb01nd the common room empty except for Bran\nand his father and the cat, but four more members of the\nVillage Council, including Cenn, sat in high-backed chairs in\nfront of the \ufb01re, mugs in hand and blue-gray pipesmoke\nwreathing their heads. For once none of the stones boards\nwere in use, and all of Bran\u2019s books stood idle on the shelf\nopposite the \ufb01replace. The men did not even talk, peering\nsilently into their ale or tapping pipestems against their\nteeth in impatience, as they waited for Tam and Bran to join\nthem.\nWorry was not uncommon for the Village Council these\ndays, not in Emond\u2019s Field, and likely not in Watch Hill, or\n\n---\n\nDocument 10\nChapter Number: 36\nChapter Name: Web of the Pattern\nPage Number: 648\n\nContent:\nCHAPTER\n36\nWeb of the Pattern\nMaster Gill took them to a corner table in the common\nroom and had one of the serving maids bring them food.\nRand shook his head when he saw the plates, with a few\nthin slices of gravy-covered beef, a spoonful of mustard\ngreens, and two potatoes on each. It was a rueful, resigned\nheadshake, though, not angry. Not enough of anything, the\ninnkeeper had said. Picking up his knife and fork, Rand\nwondered what would happen when there was nothing left.\nIt made his half-covered plate seem like a feast. It made him\nshiver.\nMaster Gill had chosen a table well away from anyone\nelse, and he sat with his back to the corner, where he could\nwatch the room. Nobody could get close enough to overhear\nwhat they said without him seeing. When the maid left, he\nsaid softly, \u201cNow, why don\u2019t you tell me about this trouble of\nyours? If I\u2019m going to help, I\u2019d best know what I\u2019m getting\ninto.\u201d\nRand looked at Mat, but Mat was frowning at his plate as\nif he were mad at the potato he was cutting. Rand took a\ndeep breath. \u201cI don\u2019t really understand it myself,\u201d he began.\nHe kept the story simple, and he kept Trollocs and Fades\nout of it. When somebody o\ufb00ered help, it would not do to\ntell them it was all about fables. But he did not think it was\nfair to understate the danger, either, not fair to pull\nsomeone in when they had no idea what they were getting\n\n---\n\nDocument 11\nChapter Number: 34\nChapter Name: The Last Village\nPage Number: 614\n\nContent:\nCHAPTER\n34\nThe Last Village\nIt was after dark when they reached Carysford, longer\nthan Rand had thought it would take from what Master\nKinch said when he let them down. He wondered if his whole\nsense of time was getting skewed. Only three nights since\nHowal Gode and Four Kings, two since Paitr had surprised\nthem in Market Sheran. Just a bare day since the nameless\nDarkfriend woman tried to kill them in the stable of The\nQueen\u2019s Man, but even that seemed a year ago, or a\nlifetime.\nWhatever was happening to time, Carysford appeared\nnormal enough, on the surface, at least. Neat, vine-covered\nbrick houses and narrow lanes, except for the Caemlyn Road\nitself, quiet and outwardly peaceful. But what\u2019s underneath?\nhe wondered. Market Sheran had been peaceful to look at,\nand so had the village where the woman.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. He had never\nlearned the name of that one, and he did not want to think\nabout it.\nLight spilled from the windows of the houses into streets\nall but empty of people. That suited Rand. Slinking from\ncorner to corner, he avoided the few people abroad. Mat\nstuck to his shoulder, freezing when the crunch of gravel\nannounced the approach of a villager, dodging from shadow\nto shadow when the dim shape had gone past.\nThe River Cary was a bare thirty paces wide there, and\nthe black water moved sluggishly, but the ford had long\n\n---\n\nDocument 12\nChapter Number: 9\nChapter Name: Tellings of the Wheel\nPage Number: 174\n\nContent:\ntheir people to escape. From the city of Manetheren, Eldrene\norganized the \ufb02ight of her people into the deepest forests\nand the fastness of the mountains.\n\u201cBut some did not \ufb02ee. First in a trickle, then a river,\nthen a \ufb02ood, men went, not to safety, but to join the army\n\ufb01ghting for their land. Shepherds with bows, and farmers\nwith pitchforks, and woodsmen with axes. Women went, too,\nshouldering what weapons they could \ufb01nd and marching\nside by side with their men. No one made that journey who\ndid not know they would never return. But it was their land.\nIt had been their fathers\u2019, and it would be their children\u2019s,\nand they went to pay the price of it. Not a step of ground\nwas given up until it was soaked in blood, but at the last the\narmy of Manetheren was driven back, back to here, to this\nplace you now call Emond\u2019s Field.

The roof of tree trunks and branches came too low to allow\nany but the women to stand. Smoke from a small \ufb01re on a bed of\nriver stones drifted up and through; the draft was enough to\nkeep the space free of smoke, but the interweaving was too thick\nto let out even a glimmer of the \ufb02ames.

He was concentrating on following\nEgwene\u2019s slender shape. He had pulled himself together just\nenough to wish she would hurry, though in truth she was\nkeeping her pace to what the two men could manage with\ntheir burden. She led them halfway down the Green, to the\nCalder house. Char blackened the edges of its thatch, and\nsmut stained the whitewashed walls. Of the houses on\neither side only the foundation stones were left, and two\npiles of ash and burned timbers. One had been the house of\nBerin Thane, one of the miller\u2019s brothers. The other had\nbeen Abell Cauthon\u2019s. Mat\u2019s father. Even the chimneys had\ntoppled.\n\u201cWait here,\u201d Egwene said, and gave them a look as if\nexpecting an answer. When they only stood there, she\nmuttered something under her breath, then dashed inside.\n\u201cMat,\u201d Rand said. \u201cIs he\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s alive,\u201d the blacksmith said.

He wondered if women\nhad a way of reading men\u2019s minds. It was an unsettling\nthought. All women are Aes Sedai. Telling himself he was\nletting the Blight get to him, he rinsed out his mouth and\nhurried to get the bay saddled.\nIt was more than a little disconcerting, having the\ncampsite disappear before he reached the horses, but by\nthe time his saddle girth was tight everything on the hill\nwinked back into view. Everyone was hurrying.\nThe seven towers stood plain in the morning light,\ndistant broken stumps, like huge, rough hills that merely\nhinted at grandeur gone. The hundred lakes were a smooth,\nunru\ufb04ed blue. Nothing broke the surface this morning.\nWhen he looked at the lakes and the ruined towers, he could\nalmost ignore the sickly things growing around the hill. Lan\ndid not seem to be avoiding looking at the towers, any more\nthan he seemed to be avoiding Nynaeve, but somehow he\nnever did as he concentrated on getting them ready to go.\nAfter the wicker panniers were fastened on the pack\nhorse, after every scrap and smudge and track were gone\nand everyone else was mounted, the Aes Sedai stood in the\nmiddle of the hilltop with her eyes closed, not even seeming\nto breathe. Nothing happened that Rand could see, except\nthat Nynaeve and Egwene shivered despite the heat and\nrubbed their arms briskly.

She said you were too tired for\nher to wake just so I could look at you. Even Bran can\u2019t get\naround her when she has her mind set.\u201d\nTam\u2019s voice was weak, but his gaze was clear and\nsteady. The Aes Sedai was right, Rand thought.

Tam listened closely, and asked sharp questions,\nso he found himself having to tell about returning to the\nfarmhouse from the woods, and that brought in the Trolloc\nhe had killed.

She had never liked stories\nabout adventures and long journeys. Her favorites were\nalways the funny ones, or stories about women outwitting\npeople who were supposed to be smarter than everyone\nelse. He was sure she had asked for tales about Lenn and\nSalya to put a burr under his shirt. Surely she could see the\nworld outside was no place for Two Rivers folk. Listening to\ntales of adventures, even dreaming about them, was one\nthing; having them take place around you would be\nsomething else again.\n\u201cOld stories, those,\u201d Thom Merrilin said, and abruptly he\nwas juggling three colored balls with each hand. \u201cStories\nfrom the Age before the Age of Legends, some say.

Ages of wonder, and Ages of horror. Ages ended by\n\ufb01re raining from the skies, and Ages doomed by snow and\nice covering land and sea. I have all stories, and I will tell all\n\n---\n\nDocument 19\nChapter Number: 23\nChapter Name: Wolfbrother\nPage Number: 413\n\nContent:\nHe shifted uncomfortably.\n\u201cYou say you\u2019re going to Caemlyn,\u201d Elyas said, \u201cbut that\nstill doesn\u2019t explain what you\u2019re doing out here, days from\nanywhere.\u201d He tossed back his fur-patch cloak and lay down\non his side, propped on one elbow and waiting expectantly.\nPerrin glanced at Egwene. Early on they had concocted\na story for when they found people, to explain where they\nwere going without bringing them any trouble. Without\nletting anyone know where they were really from, or where\nthey were really going, eventually. Who knew what careless\nword might reach a Fade\u2019s ear? They had worked on it every\nday, patching it together, honing out \ufb02aws. And they had\ndecided Egwene was the one to tell it. She was better with\nwords than he was, and she claimed she could always tell\nwhen he was lying by his face.\nEgwene began at once, smoothly. They were from the\nnorth, from Saldaea, from farms outside a tiny village.\nNeither of them had been more than twenty miles from\nhome in their whole lives before this. But they had heard\ngleemen\u2019s stories, and merchants\u2019 tales, and they wanted to\nsee some of the world. Caemlyn, and Illian. The Sea of\nStorms, and maybe even the fabled islands of the Sea Folk.\nPerrin listened with satisfaction. Not even Thom Merrilin\ncould have made a better tale from the little they knew of\nthe world outside the Two Rivers, or one better suited to\ntheir needs.\n\u201cFrom Saldaea, eh?\u201d Elyas said when she was done.\nPerrin nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s right.

Lan urgently checks horses\u2014two familiar ones plus others from the Two Rivers\u2014while warning Perrin to stay alert. The mood is tense; Lan\u2019s quick inspection suggests they\u2019re fleeing or preparing for danger. They\u2019re moving quickly, as Lan mutters, \u201cHurry, she says,\u201d implying someone (likely Moiraine) is urging haste.\n\nChapter 9, \u201cTellings of the Wheel,\u201d ends with Rand running through barren, hostile terrain pursued by Trollocs. He\u2019s physically exhausted, hearing their howls behind him, and the chapter closes with him scrambling up a ridge. \n\nThe connection? Chapter 10 follows directly after Chapter 9\u2019s climax. Rand\u2019s escape from the Trollocs leads him into the next phase: leaving the Two Rivers behind, gathering allies, and preparing for a larger journey. Chapter 10 shows the group\u2019s transition from evasion to organized departure\u2014with horses packed, tensions high, and urgency in motion\u2014mirroring Rand\u2019s desperate flight in Chapter 9. It\u2019s the shift from survival to purposeful movement toward an unknown future."}
