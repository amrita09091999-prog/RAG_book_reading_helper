They died,\nall, to make it pure, while the world was torn around them.\nKnowing they would die, they charged me to guard it\nagainst the need to come.

It was not what I was made for, but I have kept\nthe faith.\u201d He looked down at Moiraine, nodding to himself.\n\u201cI have kept faith, until it was needed. And now it ends.\u201d\n\u201cYou have kept the faith better than most of us who\ngave you the charge,\u201d the Aes Sedai said. \u201cPerhaps it will\nnot come as badly as you fear.\u201d\nThe scarred, leafy head shook slowly from side to side.\n\u201cI know an ending when it comes, Aes Sedai.

He cut his eyes toward the\ntwo prisoners for an instant.\nHe hates us even more, now, Perrin thought, for hearing\nthis. But why did he hate us in the \ufb01rst place?\n\u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d the Lord Captain said,\nholding up Perrin\u2019s axe.\nByar looked a question at his commander and waited for\nan answering nod before he broke his rigid stance to take\nthe weapon. He hefted the axe and gave a surprised grunt,\nthen whirled it in a tight arc above his head that barely\nmissed the top of the tent. He handled it as surely as if he\nhad been born with an axe in his hands. A look of grudging\nadmiration \ufb02ickered across his face, but by the time he\nlowered the axe he was expressionless once more.\n\u201cExcellently balanced, my Lord Captain. Plainly made,\nbut by a very good weaponsmith, perhaps even a master.\u201d\nHis eyes burned darkly at the prisoners. \u201cNot a villager\u2019s\nweapon, my Lord Captain. Nor a farmer\u2019s.\u201d\n\u201cNo.\u201d The gray-haired man turned toward Perrin and\nEgwene with a weary, slightly chiding smile, a kindly\ngrandfather who knew his grandchildren had been up to\nsome mischief. \u201cMy name is Geofram Bornhald,\u201d he told\nthem. \u201cYou are Perrin, I understand. But you, young woman,\nwhat is your name?\u201d\nPerrin glowered at him, but Egwene shook her head.\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, Perrin.

The\nhide should make a \ufb01ne rug for my Lord Captain\u2019s tent.\u201d\nHopper! Not even realizing what he was doing, Perrin\ngrowled and struggled against his bonds. The ropes dug into\nhis skin\u2014his wrists became slippery with blood\u2014but they\ndid not give.\nFor the \ufb01rst time Byar looked at the prisoners. Egwene\nstarted back from him. His face was as expressionless as his\nvoice, but a cruel light burned in his sunken eyes, as surely\nas \ufb02ames burned in Ba\u2019alzamon\u2019s. Byar hated them as if\nthey were enemies of long years instead of people never\nseen before tonight.\nPerrin stared back de\ufb01antly. His mouth curled into a\ntight smile at the thought of his teeth meeting in the man\u2019s\nthroat.\nAbruptly his smile faded, and he shook himself. My\nteeth? I\u2019m a man, not a wolf! Light, there has to be an end\nto this! But he still met Byar\u2019s glare, hate for hate.\n\u201cI do not care about wolf-hide rugs, Child Byar.\u201d The\nrebuke in the Lord Captain\u2019s voice was gentle, but Byar\u2019s\nback snapped rigid again, his eyes locking to the wall of the\ntent. \u201cYou were reporting on what we achieved this night,\n\n---\n\nDocument 5\nChapter Number: 19\nChapter Name: Shadow\u2019s Waiting\nPage Number: 351\n\nContent:\n\u201cThe same man?\u201d Rand exclaimed, and Mat said, \u201cIt\ncouldn\u2019t be!\u201d A glance from Moiraine silenced them.\nStillness \ufb01lled the room except for the Aes Sedai\u2019s voice.\n\u201cBefore Mordeth had been long in the city he had\nBalwen\u2019s ear, and soon he was second only to the King.\nMordeth whispered poison in Balwen\u2019s ear, and Aridhol\nbegan to change. Aridhol drew in on itself, hardened. It was\nsaid that some would rather see Trollocs come than the men\nof Aridhol. The victory of the Light is all. That was the\nbattlecry Mordeth gave them, and the men of Aridhol\nshouted it while their deeds abandoned the Light.\n\u201cThe story is too long to tell in full, and too grim, and\nonly fragments are known, even in Tar Valon. How Thorin\u2019s\nson, Caar, came to win Aridhol back to the Second\nCovenant, and Balwen sat his throne, a withered shell with\nthe light of madness in his eyes, laughing while Mordeth\nsmiled at his side and ordered the deaths of Caar and the\nembassy as Friends of the Dark. How Prince Caar came to\nbe called Caar One-Hand. How he escaped the dungeons of\nAridhol and \ufb02ed alone to the Borderlands with Mordeth\u2019s\nunnatural assassins at his heels. How there he met Rhea,\nwho did not know who he was, and married her, and set the\nskein in the Pattern that led to his death at her hands, and\nhers by her own hand before his tomb, and the fall of Aleth-\nLoriel.

Egwene was a dim shadow, and Lan\u2019s face was a blur;\nthe rest of the Warder seemed not to be there at all. He\ncould feel their eyes on him, and he wondered if he should\nexplain.\n\u201cPut on the cloaks,\u201d Lan said softly. \u201cQuickly. Bundle\nyour own. And make no sound.

The halter made every step momentous, every rock\nunderfoot potentially fatal. He walked with muscles tense,\nscanning the ground with anxious eyes.

Neither of them\ndared take their eyes o\ufb00 the ground long enough for more\nthan a glance.\nUsually he collapsed like a wrung-out rag as soon as the\nWhitecloaks let him stop, but tonight his mind was racing.\nHis skin crawled with dread that had been building for days.\nIf he closed his eyes, he would see only the things Byar\npromised for them once they reached Amador.\nHe was sure Egwene still did not believe what Byar told\nthem in that \ufb02at voice. If she did, she would not be able to\nsleep no matter how tired she was. In the beginning he had\nnot believed Byar either. He still did not want to; people just\ndid not do things like that to other people. But Byar did not\nreally threaten; as if he were talking about getting a drink of\nwater he talked about hot irons and pincers, about knives\nslicing away skin and needles piercing. He did not appear to\nbe trying to frighten them. There was never even a touch of\ngloating in his eyes. He just did not care if they were\nfrightened or not, if they were tortured or not, if they were\nalive or not. That was what brought cold sweat to Perrin\u2019s\nface once it got through to him.

How\nmany from Fal Dara have ever found the Green Man and the\nEye?\u201d\n\u201cEver?\u201d Agelmar shrugged. \u201cSince the War of the\nHundred Years, you could count them on the \ufb01ngers of one\nhand.

He stood upright, not crouching at all. Throwing\nback his head, he shouted at the ceiling. \u201cNever again! I\u2014\nwill\u2014not!\u201d He faced Agelmar as if the men \ufb02anking him\nwere his own bodyguard and the Lord of Fal Dara his equal\nrather than his captor. His tone became sleek and oily.\n\u201cThere is a misunderstanding here, Great Lord. I am\nsometimes taken by spells, but that will pass soon. Yes, soon\nI will be rid of them.\u201d Contemptuously he \ufb02icked his \ufb01ngers\nagainst the rags he wore. \u201cDo not be misled by these, Great\nLord.

It was Fain\u2019s voice, but the words\ndid not sound like the peddler at all.\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve come here because we \ufb01ght Trollocs,\u201d\nAgelmar said. \u201cAnd you are so important that someone\nwants to stop you. These people say you are a peddler\ncalled Padan Fain, and that you are following them.\u201d\nFain hesitated. He glanced at Moiraine and hurriedly\npulled his eyes away from the Aes Sedai. His gaze ran\nacross the Emond\u2019s Fielders, then jerked back to Agelmar.\n\n---\n\nDocument 14\nChapter Number: 14\nChapter Name: The Stag and Lion\nPage Number: 241\n\nContent:\nsound except the occasional long, relaxing exhalation as\ntight muscles loosened and a chill that they had come to\nthink permanent was drawn out of their bones.\n\u201cNeed anything else?\u201d Ara asked suddenly.

More hot water?\u201d\n\u201cNothing,\u201d Thom said in his reverberant voice. Eyes\nclosed, he gave an indolent wave of his hand. \u201cGo and enjoy\nthe evening. At a later time I will see that you receive more\nthan adequate recompense for your services.\u201d He settled\nlower in the tub, until the water covered everything but his\neyes and nose.\nAra\u2019s eyes went to the stools behind the tubs, where\ntheir clothes and belongings were stacked. He glanced at\nthe bow, but lingered longest over Rand\u2019s sword and Perrin\u2019s\naxe. \u201cIs there trouble downcountry, too?\u201d he said abruptly.\n\u201cIn the Rivers, or whatever you call it?\u201d\n\u201cThe Two Rivers,\u201d Mat said, pronouncing each separate\nword distinctly. \u201cIt\u2019s the Two Rivers.

They could not duplicate the\nBuilders\u2019 work, any more than could I. Those intricate curves\nand patterns your people create are beyond human eyes\nand hands to make. Perhaps we wished to avoid a poor\nimitation that would only have been an ever-present\nreminder to us of what we had lost. There is a di\ufb00erent\nbeauty in simplicity, in a single line placed just so, a single\n\ufb02ower among the rocks. The harshness of the stone makes\nthe \ufb02ower more precious. We try not to dwell too much on\nwhat is gone. The strongest heart will break under that\nstrain.\u201d\n\u201cThe rose petal \ufb02oats on water,\u201d Lan recited softly. \u201cThe\nking\ufb01sher \ufb02ashes above the pond. Life and beauty swirl in\nthe midst of death.\u201d\n\u201cYes,\u201d Agelmar said. \u201cYes. That one has always\n\n---\n\nDocument 18\nChapter Number: 53\nChapter Name: The Wheel Turns\nPage Number: 958\n\nContent:\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d Ba\u2019alzamon said simply. \u201cAnd perhaps not.\nPerhaps he can be turned to my use. Sooner or later it will\nbe so, in this Age or another.\u201d\nThe man who called himself Bors blinked. In this Age or\nanother? I thought the Day of Return was near. What matter\nto me what happens in another Age if I grow old and die\nwaiting in this one? But Ba\u2019alzamon was speaking again.\n\u201cAlready a bend is forming in the Pattern, one of many\npoints where he who will become the Dragon may be turned\nto my service. Must be turned! Better that he serve me alive\nthan dead, but alive or dead, serve me he must and will!\nThese three you must know, for each is a thread in the\npattern I mean to weave, and it will be up to you to see that\nthey are placed as I command. Study them well, that you\nwill know them.\u201d\nAbruptly all sound was gone. The man who called\nhimself Bors shifted uneasily, and saw others doing the\nsame. All but the Illianer woman, he realized. With her\nhands spread over her bosom as if to hide the rounded \ufb02esh\nshe exposed, eyes wide, half frightened and half ecstatic,\nshe was nodding eagerly as though to someone face-to-face\nwith her. Sometimes she appeared to give a reply, but the\nman who called himself Bors heard not a word. Suddenly\nshe arched backwards, trembling and rising on her toes. He\ncould not see why she did not fall, unless something unseen\nheld her. Then, just as abruptly, she settled back to her feet\nand nodded again, bowing, shivering. Even as she\n\n---\n\nDocument 19\nChapter Number: 53\nChapter Name: The Wheel Turns\nPage Number: 960\n\nContent:\n\u201cSecondly, you will watch for the three young men, and\nhave your followers watch. Be warned; they are dangerous.\u201d\nThe man who called himself Bors glanced at the \ufb01gures\n\ufb02oating in front of Ba\u2019alzamon. How can I do that? I can see\nthem, but I can\u2019t see anything except his face. His head felt\nabout to burst. Sweat slicked his hands under his thin\ngloves, and his shirt clung to his back. \u201cDangerous, Great\nLord? Farmboys? Is one of them the\u2014\u201d\n\u201cA sword is dangerous to the man at the point, but not\nto the man at the hilt. Unless the man holding the sword is a\nfool, or careless, or unskilled, in which case it is twice as\ndangerous to him as to anyone else. It is enough that I have\ntold you to know them. It is enough that you obey me.\u201d\n\u201cAs you command, Great Lord, so shall it be.\u201d\n\u201cThirdly, regarding those who have landed at Toman\nHead, and the Domani. Of this you will speak to no one.\nWhen you return to Tarabon.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u201d\nThe man who called himself Bors realized as he listened\nthat his mouth was sagging open. The instructions made no\nsense. If I knew what some of the others were told, perhaps\nI could piece it together.\nAbruptly, he felt his head grasped as though by a giant\nhand crushing his temples, felt himself being lifted, and the\nworld blew apart in a thousand starbursts, each \ufb02ash of light\nbecoming an image that \ufb02ed across his mind or spun and\ndwindled into the distance before he could more than barely\ngrasp it. An impossible sky of striated clouds, red and yellow\n\n---\n\nDocument 20\nChapter Number: 5\nChapter Name: Winternight\nPage Number: 96\n\nContent:\nRe\ufb02ected \ufb01re made the blade seem a\ufb02ame. Rand\nstarted. He had often daydreamed about owning a sword.\n\u201cGive it away? How could you give a sword like that away?\u201d\nTam snorted. \u201cNot much use in herding sheep, now is it?\nCan\u2019t plow a \ufb01eld or harvest a crop with it.\u201d For a long\nminute he stared at the sword as if wondering what he was\ndoing with such a thing. At last he let out a heavy sigh. \u201cBut\nif I am not just taken by a black fancy, if our luck runs sour,\nmaybe in the next few days we\u2019ll be glad I tucked it in that\nold chest, instead.\u201d He slid the sword smoothly back into its\nsheath and wiped his hand on his shirt with a grimace. \u201cThe\nstew should be ready. I\u2019ll dish it out while you \ufb01x the tea.\u201d\nRand nodded and got the tea canister, but he wanted to\nknow everything. Why would Tam have bought a sword? He\ncould not imagine. And where had Tam come by it? How far\naway? No one ever left the Two Rivers; or very few, at least.\nHe had always vaguely supposed his father must have gone\noutside\u2014his mother had been an outlander\u2014but a\nsword\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0? He had a lot of questions to ask once they had\nsettled at the table.\nThe tea water was boiling \ufb01ercely, and he had to wrap a\ncloth around the kettle\u2019s handle to lift it o\ufb00 the hook. Heat\nsoaked through immediately. As he straightened from the\n\ufb01re, a heavy thump at the door rattled the lock. All thoughts\nof the sword, or the hot kettle in his hand, \ufb02ew away.\n\u201cOne of the neighbors,\u201d he said uncertainly. \u201cMaster", "response": "Saidar and Saidin are the male and female halves of the True Source, respectively. Saidin can only be drawn by men, while Saidar is accessible only to women. They work together yet also oppose each other, forming the One Power. Since the Time of Madness, Saidin has been tainted by the Dark One\u2019s touch, making it impure. Saidar remains untainted but equally powerful. Both halves must be balanced for the Wheel of Time to turn properly. The context does not specify any additional differences beyond gender-based access and Saidin\u2019s contamination."}
