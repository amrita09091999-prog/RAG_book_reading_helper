        AI Response - Saidar and Saidin are the male and female halves of the True Source, respectively. Saidin can only be drawn by men, while Saidar is accessible only to women. They work together yet also oppose each other, forming the One Power. Since the Time of Madness, Saidin has been tainted by the Dark One’s touch, making it impure. Saidar remains untainted but equally powerful. Both halves must be balanced for the Wheel of Time to turn properly. The context does not specify any additional differences beyond gender-based access and Saidin’s contamination.
