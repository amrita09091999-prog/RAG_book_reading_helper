        User Query - Summarise chapter 10 and explain how is chapter 10 related to chapter 9

        AI Response - Chapter 10, “Leavetaking,” depicts Rand, Mat, and the Warder Lan entering a dimly lit stable where Perrin is waiting. Lan urgently checks horses—two familiar ones plus others from the Two Rivers—while warning Perrin to stay alert. The mood is tense; Lan’s quick inspection suggests they’re fleeing or preparing for danger. They’re moving quickly, as Lan mutters, “Hurry, she says,” implying someone (likely Moiraine) is urging haste.

Chapter 9, “Tellings of the Wheel,” ends with Rand running through barren, hostile terrain pursued by Trollocs. He’s physically exhausted, hearing their howls behind him, and the chapter closes with him scrambling up a ridge. 

The connection? Chapter 10 follows directly after Chapter 9’s climax. Rand’s escape from the Trollocs leads him into the next phase: leaving the Two Rivers behind, gathering allies, and preparing for a larger journey. Chapter 10 shows the group’s transition from evasion to organized departure—with horses packed, tensions high, and urgency in motion—mirroring Rand’s desperate flight in Chapter 9. It’s the shift from survival to purposeful movement toward an unknown future.

        Groundness - 

        Here's the evaluation based on the provided RAG RESPONSE and CONTEXT:

**Score:** 4  
**Explanation:** The RAG RESPONSE aligns well with the CONTEXT provided, accurately depicting the scenes from Chapters 9 and 10. However, there are minor inaccuracies and additional details not supported by the CONTEXT. For example, the RAG RESPONSE mentions "Chapter 9 ends with Rand running through barren, hostile terrain," which is accurate, but it adds "pursued by Trollocs" and describes the terrain in more detail than the CONTEXT does. Additionally, the RAG RESPONSE includes a speculative connection between the chapters ("Chapter 10 follows directly after Chapter 9’s climax") that isn't explicitly stated in the CONTEXT. These minor discrepancies slightly reduce the score from a perfect 5 but still maintain a strong alignment with the provided documents.

  "Explanation": "The provided context mainly consists of excerpts from Chapter 10 ('Leavetaking') and Chapter 9 ('Tellings of the Wheel'). While it does provide content from both chapters, it lacks a direct comparison or explanation of how Chapter 10 relates to Chapter 9. Therefore, about 70% of the context is relevant to answering the query, as it provides details from both chapters but fails to connect them."
